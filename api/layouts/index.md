# Layouts

Tools for building layouts and several simple layouts for quick prototyping.

## filter_body_tags

```
filter_body_tags(tags)
```

Given a list of tags, only list the ones that belong in body of an HTML document.

Source code in `src/air/layouts.py`

```
def filter_body_tags(tags) -> list:
    """Given a list of tags, only list the ones that belong in body of an HTML document."""
    return [t for t in tags if not isinstance(t, HEAD_TAG_TYPES)]
```

## filter_head_tags

```
filter_head_tags(tags)
```

Given a list of tags, only list the ones that belong in head of an HTML document.

Source code in `src/air/layouts.py`

```
def filter_head_tags(tags) -> list:
    """Given a list of tags, only list the ones that belong in head of an HTML document."""
    return [t for t in tags if isinstance(t, HEAD_TAG_TYPES)]
```

## mvpcss

```
mvpcss(*children, is_htmx=False, **kwargs)
```

Renders the basic layout with MVP.css and HTMX for quick prototyping

1. At the top level HTML head tags are put in the `<head>` tag
1. Otherwise everything is put in the `<body>`
1. `Header` and `Nav` tags are placed in the top of the body above the `Main` tag
1. If `is_htmx` is True, then the layout isn't included. This is to support the `hx_boost` feature of HTMX

The `mvpcss` function is a quick prototyping tool. It isn't designed to be extensible. Rather the `mvpcss` layout function makes it easy to roll out quick demonstrations and proofs-of-concept. For more advanced layouts like Eidos or a full-fledged MVP.css implementation, you'll have to create your own layouts.

Parameters:

| Name       | Type   | Description                                              | Default |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `children` | `Any`  | These typically inherit from air.Tag but can be anything | `()`    |
| `is_htmx`  | `bool` | Whether or not HTMX sent the request from the page       | `False` |

Example:

```
from fastapi import Depends
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
async def index(is_htmx: bool = Depends(air.is_htmx_request)):
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.Title("Home"),
        air.Article(
            air.H1("Welcome to Air"), air.P(air.A("Click to go to Dashboard", href="/dashboard")), hx_boost="true"
        ),
        is_htmx=is_htmx
    )


@app.page
async def dashboard(is_htmx: bool = Depends(air.is_htmx_request)):
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.Title("Dashboard"), air.Article(air.H1("Dashboard"), air.P(air.A("Go home", href="/")), hx_boost="true"),
        is_htmx=is_htmx
