*AIR: The new web framework that breathes fresh air into Python web development. Built with FastAPI, Starlette, and Pydantic.*

## Why use Air?

- **Powered by FastAPI** - Designed to work with FastAPI so you can serve your API and web pages from one app
- **Fast to code** - Tons of intuitive shortcuts and optimizations designed to expedite coding HTML with FastAPI
- **Air Tags** - Easy to write and performant HTML content generation using Python classes to render HTML
- **Jinja Friendly** - No need to write `response_class=HtmlResponse` and `templates.TemplateResponse` for every HTML view
- **Mix Jinja and Air Tags** - Jinja and Air Tags both are first class citizens. Use either or both in the same view!
- **HTMX friendly** - We love HTMX and provide utilities to use it with Air
- **HTML form validation powered by pydantic** - We love using pydantic to validate incoming data. Air Forms provide two ways to use pydantic with HTML forms (dependency injection or from within views)
- **Easy to learn yet well documented** - Hopefully Air is so intuitive and well-typed you'll barely need to use the documentation. In case you do need to look something up we're taking our experience writing technical books and using it to make documentation worth boasting about

## Installation

Install using `pip install -U air` or `conda install air -c conda-forge`.

For `uv` users, just create a virtualenv and install the air package, like:

```
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv init
uv add air
uv add "fastapi[standard]"
```

## A Simple Example

Create a `main.py` with:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/")
async def index():
    return air.Html(air.H1("Hello, world!", style="color: blue;"))
```

Note

This example uses [Air Tags](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/tags/index.md), which are Python classes that render as HTML. Air Tags are typed and documented, designed to work well with any code completion tool.

## Combining FastAPI and Air

Air is just a layer over FastAPI. So it is trivial to combine sophisticated HTML pages and a REST API into one app.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

import air

app = air.Air()
api = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def landing_page():
    return air.Html(
        air.Head(air.Title("Awesome SaaS")),
        air.Body(
            air.H1("Awesome SaaS"),
            air.P(air.A("API Docs", target="_blank", href="/api/docs")),
        ),
    )


@api.get("/")
def api_root():
    return {"message": "Awesome SaaS is powered by FastAPI"}


# Combining the Air and FastAPI apps into one
app.mount("/api", api)
```

## Combining FastAPI and Air using Jinja2

Want to use Jinja2 instead of Air Tags? We've got you covered.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

import air

app = air.Air()
api = FastAPI()

# Air's JinjaRenderer is a shortcut for using Jinja templates
jinja = air.JinjaRenderer(directory="templates")


@app.get("/")
def index(request: air.Request):
    return jinja(request, name="home.html")


@api.get("/")
def api_root():
    return {"message": "Awesome SaaS is powered by FastAPI"}


# Combining the Air and and FastAPI apps into one
app.mount("/api", api)
```

Don't forget the Jinja template!

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Awesome SaaS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Awesome SaaS</h1>
    <p>
      <a target="_blank" href="/api/docs">API Docs</a>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Note

Using Jinja with Air is easier than with FastAPI. That's because as much as we enjoy Air Tags, we also love Jinja!
