# -------- uv build backend (fast and strict) --------
# ======================================================================
# Why this build-backend section exists (the big picture for newcomers)
#
# Short version:
# For a library, installing the library itself into the virtual environment
# (not just its dependencies) is how modern Python packaging is meant to work.
# Many features only “exist” after install because they’re defined by packaging
# standards, not by simply having files on disk.
#
# Official Python basis:
# • PEP 517/518 build systems: Projects declare a build backend in pyproject.toml.
#   Front-ends (meaning: installers like pip/uv) build+install through that backend.
#   That produces an installed distribution,
#   with metadata (meaning: version, entry points, requirements).
# • PEP 660 editable installs: In development, you install *editable* so code
#   changes take effect without reinstalling, still producing a proper installed
#   distribution with .dist-info.
# • Entry points & console scripts: Commands and plugin hooks are created at
#   *install time* from entry points. Without install, the commands/hooks do not exist.
# • Distribution metadata: Tools read version and entry points via importlib.metadata
#   from the installed .dist-info. No install → nothing to read.
# • src/ layout: With “src/”, tests and tools should import the *installed* package
#   (editable), not in-tree files. This matches how users import from PyPI.
#
# uv’s behavior:
# • Package vs “virtual” project: Packages are installed into the venv (editable by
#   default) and therefore need a build backend. “Virtual” projects only install deps.
# • Auto-sync: `uv run` checks the lockfile/env before every run and, for packages,
#   ensures your library is installed so commands run against the installed distribution.
# • Editable by default: uv installs your project editable unless you pass --no-editable.
# • No [build-system]? By default uv won’t install your project (only deps). You can
#   force install with `tool.uv.package = true` (uv falls back to a legacy backend),
#   but declaring a proper backend is the recommended path.
#
# Real-world effects you will notice:
# 1) CLI commands appear only after install (via entry points), e.g. `air` on PATH.
# 2) pytest/flake8 plugins are discovered only when installed (via entry points).
# 3) `importlib.metadata.version("air")` works only for an installed distribution.
# 4) src/ layout behaves correctly (imports mirror what end users get from PyPI).
#
# Takeaway:
# For a Python 3.13+ library, an editable install is the spec-aligned (meaning:
# follows the standard) workflow. It enables scripts, plugins, metadata, compiled
# code, and correct src/ behavior. uv follows these standards and installs your
# package by default so everything “just works”.
# ======================================================================
# PEP 517/518: tells installers (pip/uv) how to build/install this project.

# Ensure the chosen backend is present. A version range keeps CI reproducible
# (meaning: stable over time) while allowing safe updates.
requires = ["uv_build>=0.8.7,<0.9.0"]
# Use uv’s build backend. It is fast and strict, supports PEP 660 editable installs,
# and produces correct distribution metadata for tooling.

# Prevents path leaks (meaning: accidental local imports) and matches end-user installs.
