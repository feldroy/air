Most feature requests for air core are probably best executed as a new package. In case that is not possible, to suggest an idea or ask about a feature, [consider asking about it in the discussions](https://github.com/feldroy/air/discussions/categories/questions). There might be a way to do it already.

**Describe the feature**

Tell us what you think Air needs. If possible, add code and screen shots demonstrating how you think it should work.
