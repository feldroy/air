"""Middleware are callables (functions, classes) that works with every request before it is processed by views. And also with every response before returning it.

- Middleware takes each request that comes to applications
- It can then do something to that request or run code
- Then it passes the request to be processed by the rest of the application (by individual views)
- Takes the response generated by the application
- Can do something to that response or run code
- Finally returns the response.

Background tasks run _after_ middleware.
