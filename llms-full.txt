# AIR

Air is a Python web framework that provides a friendly layer over FastAPI for building modern web applications that combine beautiful HTML pages with powerful REST APIs.

# Usage documentation

*AIR: The new web framework that breathes fresh air into Python web development. Built with FastAPI, Starlette, and Pydantic.*

## Why use Air?

- **Powered by FastAPI** - Designed to work with FastAPI so you can serve your API and web pages from one app
- **Fast to code** - Tons of intuitive shortcuts and optimizations designed to expedite coding HTML with FastAPI
- **Air Tags** - Easy to write and performant HTML content generation using Python classes to render HTML
- **Jinja Friendly** - No need to write `response_class=HtmlResponse` and `templates.TemplateResponse` for every HTML view
- **Mix Jinja and Air Tags** - Jinja and Air Tags both are first class citizens. Use either or both in the same view!
- **HTMX friendly** - We love HTMX and provide utilities to use it with Air
- **HTML form validation powered by pydantic** - We love using pydantic to validate incoming data. Air Forms provide two ways to use pydantic with HTML forms (dependency injection or from within views)
- **Easy to learn yet well documented** - Hopefully Air is so intuitive and well-typed you'll barely need to use the documentation. In case you do need to look something up we're taking our experience writing technical books and using it to make documentation worth boasting about

**Source Code**: [<https://github.com/feldroy/air>](https://github.com/feldroy/air)

## Installation

Install using `pip install -U air` or `conda install air -c conda-forge`.

For `uv` users, just create a virtualenv and install the air package, like:

```
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv init
uv add air
uv add "fastapi[standard]"
```

## A Simple Example

Create a `main.py` with:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/")
async def index():
    return air.Html(air.H1("Hello, world!", style="color: blue;"))
```

Note

This example uses [Air Tags](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/tags/index.md), which are Python classes that render as HTML. Air Tags are typed and documented, designed to work well with any code completion tool.

## Combining FastAPI and Air

Air is just a layer over FastAPI. So it is trivial to combine sophisticated HTML pages and a REST API into one app.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

import air

app = air.Air()
api = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def landing_page():
    return air.Html(
        air.Head(air.Title("Awesome SaaS")),
        air.Body(
            air.H1("Awesome SaaS"),
            air.P(air.A("API Docs", target="_blank", href="/api/docs")),
        ),
    )


@api.get("/")
def api_root():
    return {"message": "Awesome SaaS is powered by FastAPI"}


# Combining the Air and FastAPI apps into one
app.mount("/api", api)
```

## Combining FastAPI and Air using Jinja2

Want to use Jinja2 instead of Air Tags? We've got you covered.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

import air

app = air.Air()
api = FastAPI()

# Air's JinjaRenderer is a shortcut for using Jinja templates
jinja = air.JinjaRenderer(directory="templates")


@app.get("/")
def index(request: air.Request):
    return jinja(request, name="home.html")


@api.get("/")
def api_root():
    return {"message": "Awesome SaaS is powered by FastAPI"}


# Combining the Air and and FastAPI apps into one
app.mount("/api", api)
```

Don't forget the Jinja template!

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Awesome SaaS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Awesome SaaS</h1>
    <p>
      <a target="_blank" href="/api/docs">API Docs</a>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Note

Using Jinja with Air is easier than with FastAPI. That's because as much as we enjoy Air Tags, we also love Jinja!

# Quickstart

The TL;DR for getting started with Air.

## Installation

To start a new Air project, create a directory and set up your environment:

```
mkdir helloair
cd helloair
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv init
uv add air
```

Note

You can also do:

```
python -m venv .venv
pip install -U air
```

or even

```
conda install air -c conda-forge
```

## Hello, Air! Example

Create a `main.py` file in your new directory with:

main.py

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/")
async def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(air.H1("Hello, Air!"), air.P("Breathe it in."))
```

Serve your app with:

```
air run
```

Open your page by clicking this link: [<http://localhost:8000/>](http://localhost:8000/)

Here's a few interesting things about this page:

1. The page has an attractive layout and typography
1. The Python for this app is similar in design to how FastAPI code is written
1. If you typed the code out in an IDE with intellisense, you'll have seen every Air object includes useful instruction. Air is designed to be friendly to both humans and LLMs, hence every object is carefully typed and documented

Note

Air, being based on FastAPI, can be run with the FastAPI CLI through the use of the `--entrypoint` flag:

```
fastapi dev --entrypoint main:app
```

This requires installation of the `fastapi[standard]` package.

## Routing

Routing is how users on paths are directed to the correct 'view' function that handles their request.

### Basics

Air wraps FastAPI so you can use the same decorator patterns for specifying URLs:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/")
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(air.H1("Hello, Air!"), air.P("Breathe it in."))


@app.get("/air-is-grounded")
def air_is_grounded():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Air is Grounded"),
        air.P("Built on industry standard libraries including:"),
        air.Ul(
            air.Li("FastAPI"),
            air.Li("Starlette"),
            air.Li("Pydantic"),
            air.Li("Jinja"),
        ),
    )


@app.post("/form-handler")
async def form_handler(request: air.Request):  # (1)!
    ...
```

1. Form handling in Air requires `async` functions and usually an `air.Request` argument. We cover forms later on this page as well as in numerous places across the Air documentation.

### app.page decorator

To expedite `HTTP GET` pages we provide the `app.page` decorator, which can replace the `app.get()` decorator for views without arguments. `app.page` converts the name of the function to the route, converting underscores to dashes:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page  # Renders as '/'
def index():  # (1)!
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(air.H1("Hello, Air!"), air.P("Breathe it in."))


@app.page  # Renders as '/air-is-grounded'
def air_is_grounded():  # (2)!
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Air is Grounded"),
        air.P("Built on industry standard libraries including:"),
        air.Ul(
            air.Li("FastAPI"),
            air.Li("Starlette"),
            air.Li("Pydantic"),
            air.Li("Jinja"),
        ),
    )
```

1. `app.page` used over functions named `index` are converted to the `/` route.
1. `app.page` used over functions are converted to a route based on their name, with underscores converted to dashes.

### Variables in Paths

Variables can be added to URLs by marking them in curly braces like `{variable}` in the `application.get`, `application.post`, `application.put`, and `application.delete` function decorators. The function receives the `{variable}` so long as it is the correct type specified by the function.

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/users/{username}")  # (1)!
def user_detail(username: str):  # (2)!
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(air.Title(username), air.H1(username))
```

1. We've specified a variable called `username`.
1. We have defined a function argument named `username`, which is identical to the variable specified in the decorator. We also specified the Python type in this definition.

Try it out by going to <http://localhost:8000/users/Aang>

### Variables in URLs

If you specify variables in in the function definition but not the function decorator, those become URL parameters.

The function receives the `{variable}` so long as it is the correct type specified by the function.

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/users")
def user_detail(username: str):  # (1)!
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(air.Title(username), air.H1(username))
```

1. We have defined a function argument named `username`. Because `username` is not part of the decorator's URL path ('/users'), Air automatically treats it as a query parameter.

Try it out by going to <http://localhost:8000/users/?username=Aang>

### Generating URLs

Air allows you to generate URLs programmatically through the `.url()` method accessible on route functions:

```
@app.get("/users/{username}")
def user_detail(username: str):
    return air.H1(username)


# Generate URL with path parameters
url = user_detail.url(username="Aang")
# Returns: "/users/Aang"
```

This is useful for creating links and redirects without hardcoding URLs:

```
@app.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Home"),
        air.A("View user profile", href=user_detail.url(username="Aang")),
    )
```

#### Query Parameters in URLs

You can include query parameters when generating URLs using the `query_params` argument:

```
@app.get("/search")
def search(q: str = air.Query(""), page: int = air.Query(1)):
    return air.H1(f"Search: {q}")


# Generate URL with query parameters
url = search.url(query_params={"q": "air", "page": 2})
# Returns: "/search?q=air&page=2"


# Use in templates
@app.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.A(
            "Search for 'air'",
            href=search.url(query_params={"q": "air", "page": 1}),
        )
    )
```

Query parameters work with both scalar values and lists:

```
@app.get("/filter")
def filter_items(tags: list[str] | None = air.Query(None)):
    return air.H1("Filtered Items")


# Generate URL with list query parameters
url = filter_items.url(query_params={"tags": ["python", "web"]})
# Returns: "/filter?tags=python&tags=web"
```

### Other HTTP Methods

Warning

By default all HTML forms can only send `GET` and `POST` requests. If you set the form method to something else, like `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`, the browser will actually fall back to a GET request. However, the magic of HTMX allows you to send other HTTP methods from forms and links.

Air supports the `PATCH`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` methods natively:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.patch("/partial-update/{slug}")
async def partial_update(request: air.Request, slug: str):  # (1)!
    ...


@app.put("/create-item")
async def create_item(request: air.Request):  # (2)!
    ...


@app.delete("/delete/{slug}")
async def delete_item(request: air.Request, slug: str):  # (3)!
    ...
```

1. `PATCH` requests are used for partial updates of resources, such as one field being updated. The `slug` variable in the URL is passed as an argument to the function. While `POST` requests can be used for updates and is the classic method, `PATCH` is more specific to the action being taken.
1. `PUT` requests are used for creating or replacing resources. The function can handle the incoming data, typically from the request body. Like `POST`, `PUT` requests usually require `async` functions and an `air.Request` argument.
1. `DELETE` requests are used to delete resources. Similar to `PATCH`, the `slug` variable in the URL is passed as an argument to the function.

Calling these can be done via HTMX or other methods that support these HTTP verbs. Here are examples using HTMX in Air:

```
air.Form(
    # form elements here
    hx_patch=partial_update.url(slug="airbook"),
)

air.Form(
    # form elements here
    hx_put=create_item.url(),
)

air.Form(
    # form elements here
    hx_delete=delete_item.url(slug="firebook"),
)
```

## Air Tags

[Air Tags](https://docs.airwebframework.org/learn/air_tags/index.md) are one of Air's two ways to generate HTML output. They are useful for keeping file size down, general HTML delivery, and especially with fragment responses via HTMX.

### JavaScript Files

Using Air Tags to call external JavaScript files:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index():
    return air.Script(src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htmx.org@2.0.7/dist/htmx.min.js")
```

### Inline Scripts

When you need to use JavaScript inline in Air Tags:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index():
    return air.Script("alert('The Last Airbender is an awesome series.')")
```

### CSS Files

Here's how to use Air Tags to call external CSS files:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index():
    return air.Html(
        air.Head(
            air.Link(rel="stylesheet", href="https://unpkg.com/mvp.css"),
        ),
        air.Body(
            air.Main(
                air.H1("Air Web Framework"),
                air.P("The web framework for Air Nomads."),
            )
        ),
    )
```

### Inline CSS Styles

Inline CSS styles via Air are a good way to control design elements at runtime.

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index():
    return air.Html(
        air.Head(
            air.Style("h1 {color: red;}"),
        ),
        air.Body(
            air.H1("Air Web Framework"),
            air.P("The web framework for Air Nomads."),
        ),
    )
```

## Jinja

In addition to Air Tags, Air supports Jinja natively. In addition to being great at delivering HTML content, Jinja can be used to render all kinds of content.

Here's a simple Jinja template:

templates/base.html

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <main class="container">
            <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
            <p>{{ message }}</p>
        </main>
    </body>
</html>
```

And here's the view that calls it:

main.py

```
import air

app = air.Air()

# Set the Jinja render function
jinja = air.JinjaRenderer(directory="templates")  # (1)!


@app.page
def index(request: air.Request):
    return jinja(  # (2)!
        request,
        name="base.html",
        # You can pass in individual keyword arguments
        title="Hello, Air Benders",  # (3)!
        # Or a dict for the context
        context={"message": "Air + Jinja is awesome"},  # (4)!
    )
```

1. This sets up the Jinja environment for calling and rendering of templates.
1. Air automatically handles turning the `jinja` response into an HTML response.
1. Individual keyword arguments for values can be passed, these are added to the Jinja template's context dictionary.
1. This is the standard Jinja context dictionary, which is added to each template.

### Jinja + Air Tags

It is very easy to include Air Tags in Jinja. Let's first create our template:

templates/avatar.html

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <main class="container">
            <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
            {{ fragment|safe }} {# (1)! #}
        </main>
    </body>
</html>
```

1. The `safe` filter is necessary for using Air Tags in Jinja. This has security implications, so be careful what content you allow.

And here is our Python code describing the view:

main.py

```
import air

app = air.Air()

jinja = air.JinjaRenderer(directory="templates")


@app.get("/avatar")
def avatar(request: air.Request):
    return jinja(
        request,
        name="avatar.html",
        title="Hello, Air Benders",
        fragment=air.Div(air.P("We are fans of the Last Avatar"), class_="thing"),  # (1)!
    )
```

1. We can pass Air Tags into the context of a Jinja template.

Tip

Where Jinja + Air Tags truly come alive is when the base templates for a project are in Jinja. For some people this makes styling pages a bit easier. Then content, especially HTMX swaps and other fragments are rendered via Air Tags. This keeps the developer in Python, which means less context switching while working on challenges.

## Forms

In HTML, forms are the primary method of receiving data from users. Most forms receive `POST` data. Here's a basic yet workable example of receiving data using a `Request` object.

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Email form"),
        air.Form(
            air.Label("Email:", for_="email"),
            air.Input(type_="email", name="email", required=True),
            air.Button("Submit", type_="submit"),
            method="POST",
            action="/submit",
        ),
    )


@app.post("/submit")
async def email_handler(request: air.Request):  # (1)!
    form = await request.form()  # (2)!
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Email form data"),
        air.Pre(
            air.Code(form),
            air.Code(form.keys()),
            air.Code(form.values()),
        ),
    )
```

1. As Air is based off starlette, when we receive data from a form it needs to occur within an `async` view. Also, the form data is contained within the `air.Request` object.
1. Form data needs to be received via an `await` keyword on `request.form()`.

FormData is a dict-like object

While the value `FormData([('email', 'aang@example.com')])` might be displayed, the keys and values are accessed via traditional methods.

### AirForms: pydantic+forms

The pydantic library isn't just a component of Air and FastAPI, it's an industry standard validation library using Python type annotations to determine the validity of incoming data. Here's how to use it with AirForms, which use pydantic models to determine how a form is constructed.

```
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

import air


class ContactModel(BaseModel):  # (1)!
    name: str = Field(min_length=2, max_length=50)
    age: int = Field(ge=1, le=120)  # Age between 1 and 120
    email: str = Field(pattern=r"^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$")  # Basic email pattern


class ContactForm(air.AirForm):  # (2)!
    model = ContactModel


app = air.Air()


@app.page
async def index():
    """Show the form initially."""
    form = ContactForm()  # (3)!
    return air.layouts.picocss(
        air.Title("Enhanced Form Errors Demo"),
        air.H1("Contact Form - Error Message Demo"),
        air.Form(
            form.render(),  # (4)!
            air.Button("Submit", type_="submit"),
            method="post",
            action="/submit",
        ),
    )


@app.post("/submit")
async def handle_form(request: air.Request):
    """Handle form submission and show errors."""
    form = await ContactForm.from_request(request)  # (5)!

    if form.is_valid:  # (6)!
        return air.layouts.picocss(
            air.Title("Success"),
            air.H1("Success!"),
            air.P(f"Name: {form.data.name}"),
            air.P(f"Age: {form.data.age}"),
            air.P(f"Email: {form.data.email}"),
        )

    # Show form with enhanced error messages
    return air.layouts.picocss(
        air.Title("Enhanced Form Errors Demo"),
        air.H1("Contact Form - With Enhanced Error Messages"),
        air.P("Notice the specific, user-friendly error messages below:"),
        air.Form(
            form.render(),  # (7)!
            air.Br(),
            air.Button("Submit", type_="submit"),
            method="post",
            action="/submit",
        ),
        air.Hr(),
        air.Details(
            air.Summary("Technical Error Details (for developers)"),
            air.P(str(form.errors)) if form.errors else "No errors",
        ),
    )
```

1. `ContactModel` is a pydantic model that represents data we want to collect from the user.
1. `ContactForm` is an `AirForm` whose model is the `ContactModel`.
1. This instantiates the form without data.
1. Calling `.render()` on an AirForm generates the form in HTML. This follows a common pattern in Air with `.render()` methods.
1. AirForms have `.from_request()` method which takes the form from an `air.Request` and loads it into the form.
1. The `.is_valid` property of an AirForm is powered by pydantic. It returns a `bool` that can be used to control logic of what to do with form successes or failures.
1. Calling `.render()` on an AirForm generates the form in HTML. This follows a common pattern in Air with `.render()` methods.

## Server-Sent Events

Part of the HTTP specification, Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow the server to push things to the user. Air makes SSE easy to implement and maintain. Here's an example of using it to generate random lottery numbers every second.

```
import random
from asyncio import sleep

import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.Script(src="https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-sse@2.2.1/sse.js"),  # (1)!
        air.Title("Server Sent Event Demo"),
        air.H1("Server Sent Event Demo"),
        air.P("Lottery number generator"),
        air.Section(
            hx_ext="sse",  # (2)!
            sse_connect="/lottery-numbers",  # (3)!
            hx_swap="beforeend show:bottom",  # (4)!
            sse_swap="message",  # (5)!
        ),
    )


async def lottery_generator():  # (6)!
    while True:
        lottery_numbers = ", ".join([str(random.randint(1, 40)) for x in range(6)])
        # Tags work seamlessly
        yield air.Aside(lottery_numbers)  # (7)!
        await sleep(1)


@app.page
async def lottery_numbers():
    return air.SSEResponse(lottery_generator())  # (8)!
```

1. To use SSE, the source for the HTMX plugin for them has to be included in the page.
1. The `hx_ext` attribute is used to initialize the SSE plugin.
1. `sse_connect` is the endpoint where the SSE pushes from.
1. `hx_swap` tells HTMX how to swap or place elements. In this case, it says to place the incoming HTML underneath all the other content in this section. The move the focus of the page to that location.
1. The `sse_swap` attribute informs HTMX that we only want to receive SSE events of the `message` type. This is a common response and shouldn't be changed unless you have a good reason.
1. The `air.SSEResponse` needs a generator function or generator expression. Our example just generates random numbers, but people use similar functions to query databases and fetch data from APIs. Of note is that in our example instead of using `return` statements we use `yield` statements to ensure control is not lost.
1. Air Tags work great, but any type of data can be passed back.
1. Air does all heavy lifting of setting up a streaming response for us. All we need to do is pass generator functions or generator expressions into it and it just works!

# Air Tags

**Air Tags**, sometimes shortened to **Tags**, are Python classes that render HTML. They can be combined to render web pages or small components. **Air Tags** are typed and documented, working well with any code completion tool. They are designed to be an easy to write and performant HTML content generation system using Python classes to render HTML.

Note

This document covers how **Air Tags** work. The full reference for them is the [Air Tags reference](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/tags/index.md).

## How **Air Tags** work

Used individually or combined into a greater whole, every Air Tag includes a `render()` method. When the `render()` method is called it returns a HTML representation of the Air Tag, as well as all the children of the Air Tag.

This example:

```
from air import H1, Article, P

content = Article(
    H1("Air Tags"),
    P(
        "Air Tags are a fast, expressive way to generate HTML.",
        class_="subtitle",
    ),
)
print(content)  # <air.Article("Defines an article")>
```

In constructing this example, the `Article` tag has wrapped the `H1` and `P` tags. You can't see that the `H1` and `P` tags are inside, but they have been carefully stored.

This is the output of the `render()` method for the example above:

```
content.render()
```

```
<article>
  <h1>Air Tags</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Air Tags are a fast, expressive way to generate HTML.</p>
</article>
```

A shortcut for the `render()` method is the `str()` built-ins.

```
str(content)
```

```
<article>
  <h1>Air Tags</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Air Tags are a fast, expressive way to generate HTML.</p>
</article>
```

The `print()` built-in also does this conversion, but the result goes to `stdout`, so can't be saved to a variable.

```
print(content)
```

```
<article>
  <h1>Air Tags</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Air Tags are a fast, expressive way to generate HTML.</p>
</article>
```

Note

When returned from an Air view this conversion to HTML happens automatically, much like how FastAPI automatically converts `dict` responses to JSON.

## Pretty HTML renders

What if we want a more human-friendly display of HTML? We can use `.pretty_render()` method on any Air Tag:

```
print(content.pretty_render())
```

```
<article>
  <h1>Air Tags</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Air Tags are a fast, expressive way to generate HTML.</p>
</article>
```

Tip

Combine Air Tag's `.pretty_render()` method with the [rich package](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) for truly lovely colorized output.

## Attributes

**Air Tags** convert keyword arguments into attributes. So:

```
import air

air.P("Hello", id_="mine")
```

renders as:

```
<p id="mine">Hello</p>
```

Let's take a look at some additional scenarios.

### Python reserved words as attributes

Some HTML attributes are reserved words in Python. To get around that, **Air Tags** uses specific keyword arguments for these reserved words.

| Reserved Word | Use This Keyword Argument |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| class         | class\_                   |
| for           | for\_                     |
| async         | async\_                   |
| id            | id\_                      |
| as            | as\_                      |

Note

These are the reserved words that we've discocevered that conflict with HTML attributes. If you run into others, please open an issue on GitHub.

#### Setting the `class` attribute

In Python `class` is a protected word. To set the `class` attribute in **Air Tags**, use the `class_` keyword.

```
air.P("Hello", class_="plain")
```

renders as

```
<p class="plain">Hello</p>
```

#### Setting the `for` attribute

In Python `for` is a protected word. To set the `for` attribute in **Air Tags**, use the `for_` keyword.

```
air.Label("Email", air.Input(name="email", type_="email"), for_="email")
```

renders as

```
<label for="email">Email<input name="email" type="email" /></label>
```

#### Setting the `async` attribute

In Python `async` is a protected word. To set the `async` attribute in **Air Tags**, use the `async_` keyword.

```
air.Script(
    'console.log("Hello, world!");',
    async_=True,
)
```

renders as

```
<script async>
  console.log("Hello, world!");
</script>
```

### Attributes starting with special characters

To get around that in Python we can't begin function arguments with special characters, we lean into how **Air Tags** is kwargs friendly.

```
air.P("Hello", class_="plain", **{"@data": 6})
```

Renders as:

```
<p class="plain" @data="6">Hello</p>
```

### Single word attributes

To set or hide single word attributes like `@selected`, set the tag to `True` or `False` respectively.

```
air.Select(
    air.Option("South America", value="SA", selected=True),
    air.Option("North America", value="NA", selected=False),
)
```

Renders as:

```
<select>
  <option selected value="SA">South America</option>
  <option value="NA">North America</option>
</select>
```

Note

For the sake of clarity this example was rendered using `print(content.pretty_render())`.

If you need a value set to `true`, use `"true"` in Python. For example:

```
air.P("Air makes FastAPI web pages easy", draggable="true")
```

Renders as:

```
<p draggable="true">Air makes FastAPI web pages easy</p>
```

## Works well with SVGs

Unlike HTML, SVG tags are case-sensitive. You can access SVG tags by importing them from the `air.svg` module. Here's a simple example:

```
from air import svg

svg.Svg(
    svg.Circle(cx="50", cy="50", r="40", fill="blue"),
    width="100",
    height="100",
)
```

This will render the following SVG:

```
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle fill="blue" cx="50" cy="50" r="40"></circle>
</svg>
```

Note

For the sake of clarity this example was rendered using `print(content.pretty_render())`.

## Custom Air Tags

The best way to define your own **Air Tags** is to subclass the `air.Tag` class. Here's a simple example:

```
from air import Tag


class Tasty(Tag):
    pass
```

Let's instantiate this class and call its `render()` method:

```
Tasty("Ice Cream", class_="dessert").render()
```

This will produce the following HTML:

```
<tasty class="desert">Ice Cream</tasty>
```

## Functions as Custom **Air Tags**

Subclasses are not the only way to create custom Air Tags. You can also use functions to create Air Tags. This is particularly useful for putting together components quickly without needing to define a class. Here's an example of a function that creates a custom Air Tag for a [picocss card](https://picocss.com/docs/card):

```
def card(*content, header: str, footer: str):
    return air.Article(air.Header(header), *content, air.Footer(footer))
```

We can use this function to create a card:

```
card(
    air.P("This is a card with some content."),
    air.P("It can have multiple paragraphs."),
    header="Card Header",
    footer="Card Footer",
).render()
```

Which produces the following HTML:

```
<article>
  <header>Card Header</header>
  <p>This is a card with some content.</p>
  <p>It can have multiple paragraphs.</p>
  <footer>Card Footer</footer>
</article>
```

Note

For the sake of clarity this example was rendered using `print(card(...).pretty_render())`.

## Returning Multiple Children (used in HTMX)

When using HTMX to add reactivity to pages, it is common to return several **Air Tags** so that HTMX can then replace existing DOM elements with new ones. **Air Tags** are hierarchical, you need a base tag that just serves as a wrapper that doesn't generate any HTML. That tag is the `air.Tags`. Here's how to use it:

```
import air


@app.post("/cart/add/{product_id}/")
def update_cart(request: air.Request, product_id: int):
    "This is a simplified update cart view"
    # air.Tags renders the child tags without adding anything of its own
    return air.Tags(
        # Mark that an item has been added to the cart
        Button(
            "Added!",
            hx_post="/cart/add/{{product.id}}",
            hx_swap_oob="true",
            id_="add-button",
        ),
        # Cart icon quantity changed
        A(
            f"Cart {count}",
            id_="cart-icon",
            href="/cart",
            hx_trigger="polling 30s",
            hx_get="/cart-icon",
            hx_swap_oob="true",
        ),
    )
```

This will generate HTML that looks something like this, without any wrapping text around the elements we are passing to the user's browser:

```
<!-- Mark that an item has been added to the cart -->
<button hx-post="/cart/add/35" hx-swap-oob="true" id="add-button">Added!</button>
<!-- Cart icon quantity changed -->
<a id="cart-icon" href="/cart" hx-trigger="polling 30s" hx-get="/cart-icon" hx-swap-oob="true">Cart 2</a>
```

## Converting HTML to Air Tags

The easiest way to do that is with the `BaseTag.from_html_to_source` method.

```
import air

air.BaseTag.from_html_to_source("""
<html>
    <body>
        <main>
            <h1 class="header">Hello, World</h1>
        </main>
    </body>
</html>""")
```

This generates:

```
air.Html(air.Body(air.Main(air.H1("Hello, World", class_="header"))))
```

# Escaping HTML

Escaping HTML is where text is converted from tags and script that will interact with the DOM to representations of those things. For example:

Unscaped HTML:

```
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
```

Escaped HTML:

```
&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
```

This is useful for preventing security issues like code injection by malignant users who have access to text fields that display text they enter. Escaping blocks the addition of tags, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Jinja2 doesn't play it safe

By default, Jinja2 escapes nothing. It puts the burden of safety on the developer. To make Jinja2 escape text, use the `e` filter.

```
{% set h1 = "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>" %}
{{ h1|e }}
```

> ## "Jinja2 not playing it safe isn't a bad thing"
>
> We want to make it clear that Jinja2 not playing it safe isn't wrong. It can expedite development. However, it is important to note that the default can open the door to trouble. The design of Jinja2 accommodates this by making the `e` filter be so short - so it is easy and quick to use.

## Air Tags plays it safe

In contrast, by default Air Tags escapes everything.

```
air.H1("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>")
```

renders as:

```
&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
```

To provide unescaped code, Air Tags provides three options: the `Style`, `Script`, and `Raw` tags - which are described below.

### `Style`: Unescaped CSS

To avoid escaping CSS, use the `Style` tag:

```
air.Style("""
p {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: #333;
  max-width: 60ch;
  margin: 1em auto;
}
""")
```

Renders as:

```
<style>
  p {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #333;
    max-width: 60ch;
    margin: 1em auto;
  }
</style>
```

### `Script`: Unescaped JavaScript

To avoid escaping JavaScript, use the `Script` tag:

```
import air

air.Script("""
function capitalize(str) {
  if (!str) return '';
  return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
""")
```

Renders as:

```
<script>
  function capitalize(str) {
    if (!str) return "";
    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
  }
</script>
```

### `Raw`: Unescaped text

To avoid escaping anything and everything, use the `Raw` tag:

```
import air

air.Raw("<h1>Hello, World</h1>")
```

Renders as:

```
<h1>Hello, World</h1>
```

# Forms

Forms are how data is collected from users on web pages.

> ## Note
>
> This document covers how **Forms** work. The full reference for them is the [Forms reference](https://feldroy.github.io/air/api/forms/).

## A simple form example

This contact form is in the classic Starlette way, with no validation of data. However, it does show a method to build forms quickly.

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.Title("Contact Form"),
        air.H1("Contact Form"),
        air.Article(
            air.Form(
                air.Label(
                    "Email",
                    air.Input(name="email", type_="email"),
                    for_="Email",
                ),
                air.Label(
                    "Name",
                    air.Input(name="name"),
                ),
                air.Button("submit", type_="submit"),
                action="/add-contact",
                method="post",
            )
        ),
    )


@app.post("/add-contact")
async def add(request: air.Request):
    form = await request.body()
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.Title("Contact Form Result"),
        air.H1("Contact Form Result"),
        air.Pre(air.Code(form)),
    )
```

## Air Forms

Air Forms are powered by Air Models, which inherit directly from `pydantic.BaseModel`. That includes both their display and validation of data. If you have any experience with Pydantic, that will go a long way towards helping your understanding of Air Forms.

### A Sample Contact Air Form

```
from air import AirField, AirModel


class ContactModel(AirModel):
    name: str
    email: str = AirField(type="email", label="Email")


# Create an Air Form instance from the Air Model
contact_form = ContactModel.to_form()
```

### Displaying an Air Form

```
contact_form.render()
```

```
<fieldset>
  <label
    >name
    <input name="name" type="text" id="name" />
  </label>
  <label
    >Email
    <input name="email" type="email" id="email" />
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

## Validation using forms

```
# This empty dict represents a user who submitted without adding data
empty_form = {}
contact_form.validate(empty_form)
```

## Displaying a failed form

```
contact_form.render()
```

```
<fieldset>
  <label>
    name
    <input name="name" type="text" id="name" aria-invalid="true" />
    <small id="name-error">This field is required.</small>
  </label>
  <label>
    Email
    <input name="email" type="email" id="email" aria-invalid="true" />
    <small id="email-error">This field is required.</small>
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

## Converting Pydantic Models to Air Forms

You can easily convert any Pydantic model into an Air Form using the `to_form` function:

```
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr


class ContactModel(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr


ContactForm = air.to_form(ContactModel)

contact_form = ContactForm()
```

## Enhanced Error Messages

Air Forms automatically display user-friendly error messages that clearly explain validation failures:

- **Missing fields**: "This field is required."
- **Invalid numbers**: "Please enter a valid number."
- **Invalid email addresses**: "Please enter a valid email address."
- **Values too short/long**: "This value is too short." / "This value is too long."
- **URL validation**: "Please enter a valid URL."
- **And many more...**

For unknown error types, the system falls back to the technical Pydantic error message, ensuring developers always get meaningful feedback.

# Using Jinja with Air

We love Jinja. Proven and fast, it's our go-to for when we want to manually craft templates containing programmatic content. To that end, we've ensured Air works great at combining Jinja and Air Tags together.

Note

This document covers the concepts and how Jinja2 works in Air. The full reference for the tooling can be found at the [Templates API Reference](https://feldroy.github.io/air/api/templates/).

Jinja or Jinja2?

While the package is listed on [PyPI as Jinja2](https://pypi.org/project/jinja2/), that package and the [official Jinja docs](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) refers to Jinja as just "Jinja". Also, Jinja was released in 2008 and is well into the 3.x release cycle. If we want to lean into pedantry, we are arguably using Jinja 5 (base plus major releases cycles of 0.x, 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x).

Most importantly, it is the intent of the maintainer of Jinja to not only document the package as 'Jinja' but to even provide a `jinja` namespace in addition to `jinja2`.

In short, to match the Jinja documentation and the intent of the maintainer, in the Air documentation we use the term "Jinja".

## Using Jinja for the HTML Layout

Air Tags are powerful but for those of us with a lot of experience with HTML, sometimes it's easy to construct layouts using Jinja. As it is closer in look-and-feel to HTML for some of us that makes ensuring the end result looks good is easier.

Here's a simple Jinja layout file:

templates/base.html

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet"
              href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css" />
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htmx.org@2.0.6/dist/htmx.min.js"
                integrity="sha384-Akqfrbj/HpNVo8k11SXBb6TlBWmXXlYQrCSqEWmyKJe+hDm3Z/B2WVG4smwBkRVm"
                crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <title>{{ title }}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <main class="container">
            {# We need to safe the content, which can be
            a security risk. We'll cover mitigation
            of such issues later on this page.
        #}
            {{ content|safe }}
        </main>
    </body>
</html>
```

If you've used Jinja before this should look familiar. Now let's add in our Air Tags-powered content, which we'll do from the view.

main.py

```
import air
from air import Air
from air.requests import Request

app = Air()

# Set the Jinja render function
jinja = air.JinjaRenderer(directory="tests/templates")


@app.get("/")
def index(request: Request):
    content = air.Main(
        air.H2("Does Jinja work with Air Tags?"),
        air.P("Jinja works great with Air Tags"),
    )
    return jinja(
        request,
        name="base.html",
        title="FAQ",
        content=content,
    )
```

When run, this will look like this:

TODO: ADD SCREEN CAPTURE

Why don't we call the `jinja()` function `render()`?

Because Air uses `.render()` as a method name in a lot of places, especially with Air Tags. So even though `render()` instead of `jinja()` is more semantically correct, to avoid confusion and collision, we use `jinja()` instead.

# Layouts

Layouts in Air provide a way to structure complete HTML documents without the repetitive boilerplate. Air's layout system automatically handles the separation of head and body content and makes it easy to create your own custom layouts.

> ## Note
>
> This document covers how **Layouts** work. The full reference for them is the [Layouts reference](https://feldroy.github.io/air/api/layouts/).

## Understanding Air's Layout Philosophy

Air's layout functions automatically sort your tags into the right places using intelligent filtering. This allows you eliminate repetitive `air.Html`, `air.Body`, and `air.Head` boilerplate.

```
# Verbose Way
air.Html(
    air.Head(
        air.Title("My App"), air.Link(rel="stylesheet", href="style.css")
    ),
    air.Body(air.H1("Welcome"), air.P("Content here")),
)

# Air Layouts
air.layouts.mvpcss(
    air.Title("My App"),  # Automatically goes to <head>
    air.Link(rel="stylesheet", href="style.css"),  # Also goes to <head>
    air.H1("Welcome"),  # Goes to <body>
    air.P("Content here"),  # Also goes to <body>
)
```

## The Tag Filtering System

Air layouts use two core functions to organize content:

- `filter_head_tags`: Returns only tags in `(Title, Style, Meta, Link, Script, Base)`
- `filter_body_tags`: Returns all tags except `(Title, Style, Meta, Link, Script, Base)`

### Why This Matters

This automatic separation means you can focus on your content and let Air handle the document structure:

```
@app.get("/")
def home():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        # Mix head and body tags freely - Air sorts them
        air.Title("Dashboard"),
        air.H1("Welcome to the Dashboard"),
        air.Meta(name="description", content="User dashboard"),
        air.P("Your stats here"),
        air.Script(src="dashboard.js"),
    )
```

Air transforms this into proper HTML structure automatically.

## Built-in Minimal Layouts

Air provides minimal ready-to-use layouts for rapid prototyping, `mvpcss` and `picocss` for MVP.css and PicoCSS respectively. They both work and are used in the exact same way.

```
import air


@app.get("/")
def home():
    return air.layouts.picocss(  # or mvpcss
        air.Title("My App"),
        air.H1("Welcome"),
        air.P("This automatically looks great!"),
        air.Button("Get Started"),
    )
```

**What you get:**

- [MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/) styling or [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/)
- HTMX included by default for interactivity
- Container wrapper for proper spacing

**Perfect for:**

- Prototypes and demos
- Internal tools and dashboards
- Quick proofs of concept
- Learning Air basics

## Beyond Built-in Layouts

The included layouts are designed for **quick prototyping**, not production commercial applications. Custom layouts give you complete control while preserving Air's automatic tag filtering benefits.

Here's the foundational pattern for any Air layout:

```
import air


def my_layout(*children, **kwargs):
    """My custom layout function."""
    # 1. Separate head and body content
    head_tags = air.layouts.filter_head_tags(children)
    body_tags = air.layouts.filter_body_tags(children)

    # 2. Build your custom structure
    return air.Html(
        air.Head(
            # Your custom head content
            *head_tags  # User's head tags
        ),
        air.Body(
            # Your custom body structure
            # Header content
            air.Main(*body_tags),  # User's body content
            # Footer Content
        ),
    ).render()
```

**Key principles:**

1. **Always filter tags** using Air's helper functions
1. **Use `*head_tags` and `*body_tags`** to include user content
1. **Return `.render()`** to get the final HTML string

This first example shows how to create a password-less authentication flow using Air. This is a toy example that uses sessions to keep track of the logged-in user. In a real application, you would want to use a more secure method of authentication, with passwords or OAuth.

```
import air
from time import time

app = air.Air()
app.add_middleware(air.SessionMiddleware, secret_key="change-me")


@app.page
async def index(request: air.Request):
    if "username" in request.session:
        # User is logged in provide a logout link
        action = air.Tags(
            air.H1(request.session["username"]),
            air.P(request.session.get("logged_in_at")),
            air.P(air.A("Logout", href="/logout")),
        )
    else:
        # login the user
        action = air.Form(
            air.Label("Name:", for_="username"),
            air.Input(
                type_="text",
                name="username",
                id_="username",
                required=True,
                autofocus=True,
            ),
            air.Button("Login", type_="submit"),
            action="/login",
            method="post",
        )
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(action)


@app.post("/login")
async def login(request: air.Request):
    form = await request.form()
    if username := form.get("username"):
        # Create session
        request.session["username"] = username
        request.session["logged_in_at"] = time()

    return air.RedirectResponse("/", status_code=302)


@app.page
async def logout(request: air.Request):
    request.session.pop("username")
    return air.RedirectResponse("/")
```

## Authentication with Dependencies

In Air and FastAPI apps we frequently rely on dependencies to handle authentication. Dependencies are a powerful way to share logic between different parts of your application. Here's a simple authentication dependency example:

```
from fastapi import HTTPException

import air


def require_login(request: air.Request):
    # Replace this with your actual login check
    user = request.session.get("user") if hasattr(request, "session") else None

    if not user:
        # Redirect if not logged in
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=307,
            headers={"Location": "/login"},
        )
    return user
```

In Air, like FastAPI, session objects need to be serializable to JSON. That means you can't store complex objects like database models directly in the session. Instead, store simple identifiers (like user IDs) and fetch the full user details from your database as needed.

Attaching this dependency to a route ensures that only authenticated users can access it. If a user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the login page. Here's how you can use the `require_login` dependency in a route:

```
import air

app = air.Air()
air.add_middleware(air.SessionMiddleware, secret_key="change-me")


# --- Dependency ---
def require_login(request: air.Request):
    # Replace this with your actual login check
    user = request.session.get("user") if hasattr(request, "session") else None

    if not user:
        # Redirect if not logged in
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=307,
            headers={"Location": "/login"},
        )
    return user


# --- Routes ---
@app.page
async def dashboard(request: air.Request, user=Depends(require_login)):
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1(f"Dashboard for {request.session['user']['username']}"),
        air.P(air.A("Logout", href="/logout")),
    )
```

Here's a more complete example that includes a login page, a protected dashboard page, and logout functionality using the `require_login` dependency:

```
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException

import air

app = air.Air()
app.add_middleware(air.SessionMiddleware, secret_key="change-me")


# --- Dependency ---
def require_login(request: air.Request):
    # Replace this with your actual login check
    user = request.session.get("user") if hasattr(request, "session") else None

    if not user:
        # Redirect if not logged in
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=307,
            headers={"Location": "/login"},
        )
    return user


# --- Routes ---
@app.page
async def index(request: air.Request):
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(air.H1("Landing page"), air.P(air.A("Dashboard", href="/dashboard")))


@app.page
async def login():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Login"),
        # login the user
        air.Form(
            air.Label("Name:", for_="username"),
            air.Input(
                type_="text",
                name="username",
                id_="username",
                required=True,
                autofocus=True,
            ),
            air.Label("Password:", for_="password"),
            air.Input(
                type_="password",
                name="password",
                id_="password",
                required=True,
                autofocus=True,
            ),
            air.Button("Login", type_="submit"),
            action="/login",
            method="post",
        ),
    )


@app.page
async def dashboard(request: air.Request, user=Depends(require_login)):
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1(f"Dashboard for {request.session['user']['username']}"),
        air.P(air.A("Logout", href="/logout")),
    )


@app.post("/login")
async def login(request: air.Request):
    form = await request.form()
    request.session["user"] = dict(username=form.get("username"))
    return air.RedirectResponse("/dashboard", status_code=303)


@app.page
async def logout(request: air.Request):
    request.session.pop("user")
    return air.RedirectResponse("/", status_code=303)
```

# Bigger Applications

When building larger applications with Air, you may find yourself needing to organize your code better, manage multiple routes, or even mount different applications together. This guide will help you understand how to structure your Air applications for scalability and maintainability.

## Routing Separate Apps Together

Note

This approach shares state between the composited efforts. This means that authentication, database pooling, and other things will be usable between components. The [API reference](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/routing/index.md) for this documentation displays options for more controls like Router-specific lifespans, URL prefixes, and more.

Let's imagine we have a landing page that links to a sophisticated dashboard. While our example dashboard is trivial, let's assume it is complicated enough that we want it in a separate Python module yet share state. We design the `main.py` as we would a normal Air application:

main.py

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(air.H1("Avatar Data"), air.P(air.A("Dashboard", href="/dashboard")))
```

Now for the dashboard, instead of using the typical `air.Air` tool to instantiate our application, we use `air.AirRouter` like so:

dashboard.py

```
import air

router = air.AirRouter()


@router.page
def dashboard():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(air.H1("Avatar Data Dashboard"), air.P(air.A("<- Home", href="/")))
```

Now if we go back to our `main.py` we can use the `app.include_router()` method to include the dashboard in our app:

main.py

```
import air
from .dashboard import router

app = air.Air()
app.include_router(router)


@app.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Avatar Data"), air.P(air.A("Dashboard", href="/dashboard"))
    )
```

If run locally these links should work:

- <http://localhost:8000>
- <http://localhost:8000/dashboard>

## Mounting Air and FastAPI apps inside Air apps

Warning

This approach does not share state between the apps. That means attempting to share authentication and database pooling will not function predictably, if at all.

One of the really nice features of Air is the ability to mount apps inside each other. This allows you to create modular applications where different parts of your app can be developed and maintained independently. To do this, we lean on Starlette's `mount` functionality that Air inherits through FastAPI.

```
import air

# Create the main app, which serves as the entry point
app = air.Air(title="Air")


@app.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(air.H1("Air landing page"), air.P(air.A("Shop", href="/shop")))


# Creating a separate app for the shop,
# which could be placed in a different file
shop = air.Air(title="Air shop")


@shop.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(air.H1("Shop for Air things"))


# Mount the shop app to the main app
# This allows you to access the shop at /shop
app.mount("/shop", shop)
```

## Mounting FastAPI inside of Air apps

You can easily mount a FastAPI app inside an Air app. A common scenario is to have a FastAPI app that serves an API, while your main Air app serves the landing, billing, and usage frontends.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

import air

# Create the landing page app using Air
app = air.Air()


@app.get("/")
def landing_page():
    return air.Html(
        air.Head(air.Title("Awesome SaaS")),
        air.Body(
            air.H1("Awesome SaaS"),
            air.P(air.A("API Docs", target="_blank", href="/api/docs")),
        ),
    )


api = FastAPI()


@api.get("/")
def api_root():
    return {"message": "Awesome SaaS is powered by FastAPI"}


# Combining the Air and and FastAPI apps into one
app.mount("/api", api)
```

## Mounting FastAPI apps inside each other

Mounting one FastAPI app is outside the scope of this guide. We recommend reading [FastAPI's Bigger Application](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications) reference.

# Charts

Air is great for building charts. Using [plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/), here's a simple chart example.

```
import json

import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/")
def index():
    title = "Air Chart Demo"
    data = json.dumps({
        "data": [
            {
                "x": [0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10],
                "y": [2, 9, 0, 4, 3, 6],
                "type": "scatter",
            },
            {
                "x": [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10],
                "y": [9, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0],
                "type": "scatter",
            },
        ],
        "title": "Fun charts with Plotly and Air",
        "description": ("This is a demonstration of how to build a chart using Plotly and Air"),
        "type": "scatter",
    })
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.Script(src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-3.0.1.min.js"),
        air.Title(title),
        air.H1(title),
        air.Article(
            air.P(
                "Made with ",
                air.A("Air", href="https://github.com/feldroy/air"),
                " and ",
                air.A("Plotly", href="https://plotly.com/javascript/"),
            ),
            air.Div(id_="chart"),
            air.Script(f"var data = {data}; Plotly.newPlot('chart', data);"),
        ),
    )
```

Air makes it possible to build charts that pull data from servers and animate the results. Here's an example being supplied with random numbers for the Air server.

```
import air

air.Children(
    air.Div(id_="randomChart"),
    air.Script(
        """
        var data = {"data": [{"x": [0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10], "y": [2, 9, 0, 4, 3, 6], "type": "scatter"}, {"x": [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10], "y": [9, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0], "type": "scatter"}], "title": "Fun charts with Plotly and Air", "description": "This is a demonstration of how to build a chart using Plotly and Air", "type": "scatter"};
        Plotly.newPlot('randomChart', data);""",
        # ID is used to help HTMX know where to replace data
        id_="dataSource",
        # Trigger HTMX to call new data every 2 seconds
        hx_trigger="every 2s",
        # Use HTMX to fetch new info from the /data route
        hx_get="/data",
        # When the data is fetched, replace the whole tag
        hx_swap="outerHTML",
    ),
)
```

# Forms & validation

Built on Pydantic's `BaseModel`, the `air.AirForm` class is used to validate data coming from HTML forms.

```
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import Depends, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
import air

app = air.Air()


class FlightModel(BaseModel):
    flight_number: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    destination: str = Field(..., min_length=1)


class FlightForm(air.AirForm):
    model = FlightModel


@app.page
async def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Flight Form"),
        air.Form(
            air.Input(name="flight_number", placeholder="flight number"),
            air.Input(name="destination", placeholder="destination"),
            air.Button("Submit", type_="submit"),
            method="post",
            action="/flight-info",
        ),
    )


@app.post("/flight-info")
async def flight_info(request: Request):
    flight = await FlightForm.from_request(request)
    if flight.is_valid:
        return air.Html(
            air.H1(f"{flight.data.flight_number} → {flight.data.destination}")
        )

    # Show form with enhanced error messages and preserved user input
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Flight Form"),
        air.P("Please correct the errors below:"),
        air.Form(
            flight.render(),  # Automatically shows user-friendly error messages
            air.Button("Submit", type_="submit"),
            method="post",
            action="/flight-info",
        ),
    )
```

## Enhanced Form Features

### User-Friendly Error Messages

Air Forms automatically convert technical Pydantic validation errors into clear, actionable messages:

```
# Instead of: "Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer"
# Users see: "Please enter a valid number."

# Instead of: "Field required"
# Users see: "This field is required."
```

### Value Preservation

When validation fails, user input is automatically preserved, so users don't have to re-enter their data:

```
# User submits: {"flight_number": "AB123", "destination": ""}
# After validation error, the form still shows "AB123" in the flight_number field
flight = await FlightForm.from_request(request)
if not flight.is_valid:
    return show_form_with_errors(flight)  # Values are preserved automatically
```

## Coming Soon: Dependency-Injection Form Handling

It is possible to use dependency injection to manage form validation.

NOTE: This functionality is currently in development. This feature was working before but currently does not work.

```
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel
import air

app = air.Air()


class FlightModel(BaseModel):
    flight_number: str
    destination: str


class FlightForm(air.AirForm):
    model = FlightModel


@app.page
async def flight():
    return air.Html(
        air.H1("Flight Form"),
        air.Form(
            air.Input(name="flight_number"),
            air.Input(name="destination"),
            air.Button("Submit", type_="submit"),
            method="post",
            action="/flight-info",
        ),
    )


@app.post("/flight-info")
async def flight_info(
    flight: Annotated[FlightForm, Depends(FlightForm.validate)],
):
    if flight.is_valid:
        return air.Html(
            air.H1(f"{flight.data.flight_number} → {flight.data.destination}")
        )
    return air.Html(air.H1(f"Errors {len(flight.errors)}"))
```

# Minimal app

The "Hello, World" of Air is:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/")
async def index():
    return air.H1("Hello, Air!", style="color: blue;")
```

# The app.page decorator

For simple HTTP GET requests, Air provides the handy @app.page shortcut. It converts the name of the function to a URL, where underscores are replaced with dashes and `index` is replaced with '/'.

When to use @app.page vs @app.get

`@app.page` is convenient when the URL path can be derived from the function name.

Use `@app.get("/path")` instead when you need to:

- Specify a custom URL path that doesn't match the function name
- Include path parameters like `/users/{user_id}`

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index():
    # Same as route app.get('/')
    return air.H1("Welcome to our site!")


@app.page
def dashboard():
    # Same as route app.get('/dashboard')
    return air.H1("Dashboard")


@app.page
def show_item():
    # same as app.get('/show-item')
    return air.H1("Showing an item")
```

An option has been added to change the path separator to forward slashes instead of dashes.

```
import air

app = air.Air(path_separator="/")


@app.page
def about_us():
    # same as app.get('/about/us`)
    return air.H1("About us!")
```

# Running as FastAPI

FastAPI is the direct ancestor of Air. A lot of the same concepts apply, and with a little effort Air apps can be run as FastAPI applications. This is useful for deployment scenarios where FastAPI is already supported, such as in [fastapicloud.com](https://fastapicloud.com/)

To run an Air app as a FastAPI app, use the FastAPI entrypoint in your `pyproject.toml`, where `main` is your core Python module and `app` is your Air application instance:

```
[tool.fastapi]
entrypoint = "main:app"
```

Now Air will run with `fastapi dev` or `fastapi run`, and deploy to FastAPI-compatible platforms.

Reference: [FastAPI Custom Entrypoint - Location](https://fastapicloud.com/docs/builds-and-deployments/configuring-fastapi/#custom-entrypoint---location).

# Serving static files

You can serve static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images using Air's built-in static file serving capabilities. In this example, we’ll create a simple Air app that serves static files from a `static` directory, but the name of the directory can be anything (`public` is also common).

```
import air

app = air.Air()
app.mount("/static", air.StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")


@app.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Welcome to My Site!"),
        air.Link(rel="stylesheet", href="/static/styles.css"),
        air.Script(src="/static/scripts.js"),
        air.Img(src="/static/images/logo.png", alt="Logo"),
    )
```

Example:

```

@app.get("/")
def index() -> air.H1:
    return air.H1("Hello, World!")
```

This preserves most FastAPI initialization parameters while setting

- AirResponse as the default response class.
- AirRoute as the default route class.

# Background Tasks

Background Tasks are Python functions that are called after a response is returned to the user. They are useful for long running tasks like emails or batch processing.

Background tasks in Air, for those times a long-running process is needed that doesn't force the user to wait.

## BackgroundTasks

Bases: `BackgroundTasks`

A collection of background tasks that will be called after a response has been sent to the client.

Example:

```
import pathlib

import air

app = air.Air()


def write_notification(email: str, message: str = "") -> None:
    content = f"notification for {email}: {message}"
    pathlib.Path("log.txt").write_text(content)


@app.post("/send-notification/{email}")
def send_notification(email: str, background_tasks: air.BackgroundTasks) -> air.P:
    message = "some notification"
    background_tasks.add_task(write_notification, email, message=message)
    return air.P(f"Notification sent to {email}")
```

### add_task

```
add_task(func, *args, **kwargs)
```

Add a function to be called in the background after the response is sent.

Source code in `src/air/background.py`

```
def add_task[**P, T](
    self,
    func: Annotated[
        Callable[P, T],
        Doc(

            The function to call after the response is sent.

            It can be a regular `def` function or an `async def` function.

        ),
    ],
    *args: P.args,
    **kwargs: P.kwargs,
) -> None:
    """Add a function to be called in the background after the response is sent."""
    return super().add_task(func, *args, **kwargs)
```

# Dependencies

Air provides dependency injection utilities to help you build responsive web applications.

## HTMX Request Detection

The `is_htmx_request` dependency allows you to detect whether a request is coming from an HTMX action, enabling you to return different responses for HTMX vs regular HTTP requests.

### Common Use Cases

- Return partial HTML fragments for HTMX requests and full pages for regular requests
- Provide different response formats (JSON for HTMX, redirects for forms)
- Implement progressive enhancement patterns

### Examples

#### Basic Usage

```
import air
from fastapi import Depends

app = air.App()


@app.get("/users")
def get_users(is_htmx: bool = Depends(air.is_htmx_request)):
    users = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

    if is_htmx:
        # Return just the user list for HTMX partial updates
        return air.Ul([air.Li(user) for user in users])
    else:
        # Return full page for regular requests
        return air.Html(
            [
                air.Head(air.Title("Users")),
                air.Body(
                    [
                        air.H1("User List"),
                        air.Ul([air.Li(user) for user in users]),
                    ]
                ),
            ]
        )
```

#### Form Handling

```
@app.post("/submit")
def submit_form(is_htmx: bool = Depends(air.is_htmx_request)):
    if is_htmx:
        return air.Div("Success!", class_="alert-success")
    else:
        return air.RedirectResponse("/success", status_code=303)
```

Tools for handling dependencies, for things like handling incoming data from client libraries like HTMX.

## is_htmx_request

```
is_htmx_request = Depends(_is_htmx_request)
```

# Exceptions

## default_404_exception_handler

```
default_404_exception_handler(request, exc)
```

Default 404 exception handler. Can be overloaded.

Returns:

| Type          | Description                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `AirResponse` | An AirResponse with a 404 status code and error page. |

Example:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/")
def index() -> air.AirResponse:
    return air.AirResponse(air.P("404 Not Found"), status_code=404)
```

Source code in `src/air/exception_handlers.py`

```
def default_404_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: Exception) -> AirResponse:
    """Default 404 exception handler. Can be overloaded.

    Returns:

    Example:

        import air

        app = air.Air()


        @app.get("/")
        def index() -> air.AirResponse:
            return air.AirResponse(air.P("404 Not Found"), status_code=404)
    """
    return AirResponse(

            P(f"URL: {request.url}"),
        ),
        status_code=404,
    )
```

## default_404_router_handler

```
default_404_router_handler(router_name)
```

Build an ASGI app that delegates the 404 to the default_404_exception_handler.

Returns:

# Forms

Display and Validation of HTML forms. Powered by pydantic.

Pro-tip: Always validate incoming data.

## AirForm

```
AirForm(initial_data=None)
```

A form handler that validates incoming form data against a Pydantic model. Can be used with awaited form data or with FastAPI's dependency injection system.

Example:

```
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel

import air

app = air.Air()


class FlightModel(BaseModel):
    flight_number: str
    destination: str


class FlightForm(air.AirForm):
    model = FlightModel


@app.post("/flight")
async def flight_form(request: air.Request) -> air.Html:
    # Awaited form data
    flight = await FlightForm.from_request(request)
    if flight.is_valid:
        return air.Html(air.H1(flight.data.flight_number))
    errors = len(flight.errors or [])
    return air.Html(air.H1(air.Raw(str(errors))))


@app.post("/flight-depends")
async def flight_form_depends(flight: Annotated[FlightForm, Depends(FlightForm.from_request)]) -> air.Html:
    # Dependency injection
    if flight.is_valid:
        return air.Html(air.H1(flight.data.flight_number))
    errors = len(flight.errors or [])
    return air.Html(air.H1(air.Raw(str(errors))))
```

```
def __init__(self, initial_data: dict | None = None) -> None:
    if self.model is None:
        msg = "model"

    return [t for t in tags if not isinstance(t, HEAD_TAG_TYPES)]
```

## filter_head_tags

```
filter_head_tags(tags)
```

Given a list of tags, only list the ones that belong in head of an HTML document.

Returns:

## mvpcss

```
mvpcss(*children, is_htmx=False, **kwargs)
```

Renders the basic layout with MVP.css and HTMX for quick prototyping

1. At the top level HTML head tags are put in the `<head>` tag
1. Otherwise everything is put in the `<body>`
1. `Header` and `Nav` tags are placed in the top of the body above the `Main` tag
1. If `is_htmx` is True, then the layout isn't included. This is to support the `hx_boost` feature of HTMX

The `mvpcss` function is a quick prototyping tool. It isn't designed to be extensible. Rather the `mvpcss` layout function makes it easy to roll out quick demonstrations and proofs-of-concept. For more advanced layouts like Eidos or a full-fledged MVP.css implementation, you'll have to create your own layouts.

Parameters:

| Name       | Type   | Description                                              | Default |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `children` | `Any`  | These typically inherit from air.Tag but can be anything | `()`    |
| `is_htmx`  | `bool` | Whether or not HTMX sent the request from the page       | `False` |

Returns:

| Type   | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| \`Html | Children\`  |

Example:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page

# Middleware

Middleware are callables (functions, classes) that works with every request before it is processed by views. And also with every response before returning it.

- Middleware takes each request that comes to applications
- It can then do something to that request or run code
- Then it passes the request to be processed by the rest of the application (by individual views)
- Takes the response generated by the application
- Can do something to that response or run code
- Finally returns the response.

Background tasks run *after* middleware.

## SessionMiddleware

Bases: `SessionMiddleware`

Used to manage sessions.

Example:

```
from time import time

import air

app = air.Air()
app.add_middleware(air.SessionMiddleware, secret_key="change-me")


@app.page
async def index(request: air.Request) -> air.Html | air.Children:
    if "first-visited" not in request.session:
        request.session["first-visited"] = time()
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1(str(request.session.get("first-visited"))),
        air.P("Refresh the page and the timestamp won't change"),
        air.P(air.A("Reset the time stamp", href="/reset")),
    )


@app.page
async def reset(request: air.Request) -> air.responses.RedirectResponse:
    request.session.pop("first-visited")
    return air.responses.RedirectResponse("/")
```

# Forms

Model utilities for Air.

Provides a thin wrapper around :class:`pydantic.BaseModel` that knows how to generate matching :class:`air.forms.AirForm` subclasses on demand.

# Requests

`air.requests.Request` is an wrapper for [`starlette.requests.Request`](https://www.starlette.io/requests/), giving Air users a consistent import path. It adds an `htmx` object that includes a lot of quite useful utility methods.

______________________________________________________________________

## Usage

```
import air
from air.requests import Request

app = air.Air()


@app.page
async def request_info(request: Request):
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Request Info"),
        air.P(f"Method: {request.method}"),
        air.P(f"URL: {request.url}"),
        air.P(f"Headers: {dict(request.headers)}"),
        air.P(f"Query Params: {dict(request.query_params)}"),
    )
```

## Practical Recipes

Here are smaller, focused examples for specific use cases:

### Accessing Query Parameters

```
import air
from air.requests import Request

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/search")
async def search(request: Request):
    query = request.query_params.get("q", "none")
    return air.Pre(query)
```

### Reading JSON Body

```
import air
from air.requests import Request
from air.responses import JSONResponse

app = air.Air()


@app.post("/items")
async def create_item(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    return JSONResponse({"item": data})
```

### Reading Form Data

```
import air
from air.requests import Request
from air.responses import JSONResponse

app = air.Air()


@app.post("/login")
async def login(request: Request):
    form = await request.form()
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.Section(air.Aside({"username": form.get("username")}))
    )
```

### Accessing the HTMX object

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index(request: air.Request):
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("From HTMX?"),
        air.P(f"This request came from an HTMX element on a page: {request.htmx}"),
    )
```

Tools for handling requests.

## AirRequest

Bases: `Request`

A wrapper around `starlette.requests.Request` that includes the `HtmxDetails` object.

Note

AirRequest is available in Air 0.36.0+

## HtmxDetails

```
HtmxDetails(headers, url)
```

Attached to every Request served by Air; provides helpers for HTMX-aware handling. Derived values are computed once in `__post_init__`.

### __bool__

```
__bool__()
```

`True` if the request was made with htmx, otherwise `False`. Detected by checking if the `HX-Request` header equals `true`.

This method allows you to change content for requests made with htmx:

Returns:

| Type   | Description                                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bool` | True if the request was made with htmx, otherwise False. |

Example:

```
import air
from random import randint

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index(request: air.Request):

    if request.htmx:
        return air.H1(
            "Click me: ", randint(1, 100),
            id_="number",
            hx_get="/",
            hx_swap="outerHTML"
        )
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1(
            "Click me: ", randint(1, 100),
            id_="number",
            hx_get="/",
            hx_swap="outerHTML"
        )
    )
```

Source code in `src/air/requests.py`

```
def __bool__(self) -> bool:
    """`True` if the request was made with htmx, otherwise `False`. Detected by checking if
    the `HX-Request` header equals `true`.

    This method allows you to change content for requests made with htmx:

    Returns:
        True if the request was made with htmx, otherwise False.

        @app.page
        def index(request: air.Request):

            if request.htmx:
                return air.H1(
                    "Click me: ", randint(1, 100),
                    id_="number",
                    hx_get="/",
                    hx_swap="outerHTML"
                )
            return air.layouts.mvpcss(
                air.H1(
                    "Click me: ", randint(1, 100),
                    id_="number",
                    hx_get="/",
                    hx_swap="outerHTML"
                )
            )
    """

    return self.headers.get("HX-Request") == "true"
```

### boosted

```
boosted = field(init=False)
```

`True` if the request came from an element with the `hx-boost` attribute. Detected by checking if the `HX-Boosted` header equals `true`.

Example:

```
import air
from random import randint

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index(request: air.Request):

    if request.htmx.boosted:
        # Do something here
```

### current_url

```
current_url = field(init=False)
```

The current URL in the browser that htmx made this request from, or `None` for non-htmx requests. Based on the `HX-Current-URL` header.

### current_url_abs_path

```
current_url_abs_path = field(init=False)
```

The absolute-path form of `current_url`, that is the URL without scheme or netloc, or None for non-htmx requests.

This value will also be `None` if the scheme and netloc do not match the request. This could happen if the request is cross-origin, or if Air is not configured correctly.

### history_restore_request

```
history_restore_request = field(init=False)
```

`True` if the request is for history restoration after a miss in the local history cache. Detected by checking if the `HX-History-Restore-Request` header equals `true`.

### prompt

```
prompt = field(init=False)
```

The user response to `hx-prompt` if it was used, or `None`.

### target

```
target = field(init=False)
```

The `id` of the target element if it exists, or `None`. Based on the `HX-Target` header.

### trigger

```
trigger = field(init=False)
```

The `id` of the triggered element if it exists, or `None`. Based on the `HX-Trigger` header.

### trigger_name

```
trigger_name = field(init=False)
```

The name of the triggered element if it exists, or `None`. Based on the `HX-Trigger-Name` header.

## Request

```
Request = AirRequest
```

Alias for the `AirRequest` Request class; use it if it improves clarity.

# Responses

Air uses custom response classes to improve the developer experience.

## TagResponse

```
TagResponse = AirResponse
```

Alias for the `AirResponse` Response class; use it if it improves clarity.

## AirResponse

Bases: `HTMLResponse`

Response class to handle air.tags.Tags or HTML (from Jinja2).

### render

```
render(tag)
```

Render Tag elements to bytes of HTML.

Returns:

| Type    | Description  |
| ------- | ------------ |
| \`bytes | memoryview\` |

Source code in `src/air/responses.py`

```
@override
def render(self, tag: BaseTag | str) -> bytes | memoryview:  # ty: ignore[invalid-method-override]
    """Render Tag elements to bytes of HTML.

    Returns:
        Rendered HTML as bytes or memoryview.
    """
    return super().render(str(tag))
```

## RedirectResponse

```
RedirectResponse(
    url,
    status_code=status.HTTP_307_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT,
    headers=None,
    background=None,
)
```

Bases: `RedirectResponse`

Response class for HTTP redirects.

Use `air.RedirectResponse` to redirect users to a different URL.

Example

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/old-page")
def old_page():
    # Permanent redirect (301) - browsers cache this
    return air.RedirectResponse(url="/new-page", status_code=301)


@app.page
def legacy():
    # Using @app.page works too - redirects from /legacy
    return air.RedirectResponse(url="/", status_code=301)
```

Parameters:

| Name          | Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Default                                                     |

## SSEResponse

Bases: `StreamingResponse`

Response class for Server Sent Events

Example:

```
# For tags
import random
from asyncio import sleep

import air

app = air.Air()


@app.page
def index():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.Script(src="https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-sse@2.2.1/sse.js"),
        air.Title("Server Sent Event Demo"),
        air.H1("Server Sent Event Demo"),
        air.P("Lottery number generator"),
        air.Section(
            hx_ext="sse",
            sse_connect="/lottery-numbers",
            hx_swap="beforeend show:bottom",
            sse_swap="message",
        ),
    )

async def lottery_generator():
    while True:
        lottery_numbers = ", ".join(
            [str(random.randint(1, 40)) for x in range(6)]
        )
        # Tags work seamlessly
        yield air.Aside(lottery_numbers)
        # As do strings. Non-strings are cast to strings via the
        # str built-in
        yield "Hello, world"
        await sleep(1)


@app.get("/lottery-numbers")
async def get():
    return air.SSEResponse(lottery_generator())
```

Routing

If you need to knit several Python modules with their own Air views into one, that's where Routing is used. They allow the near seamless combination of multiple Air apps into one. Larger sites are often built from multiple routers.

Let's imagine we have an e-commerce store with a shopping cart app. Use instantiate a `router` object using `air.AirRouter()` just as we would with `air.App()`:

```
# cart.py
import air

router = air.AirRouter()


@router.page
def cart():
    return air.H1("I am a shopping cart")
```

Then in our main page we can load that and tie it into our main `app`.

```
import air
from cart import router as cart_router

app = air.Air()
app.include_router(cart_router)


@app.page
def index():
    return air.H1("Home page")
```

Note that the router allows sharing of sessions and other application states.

In addition, we can add links through the `.url()` method available on route functions, which generates URLs programmatically:

```
import air
from cart import router as cart_router, cart

app = air.Air()
app.include_router(cart_router)


@app.page
def index():
    return air.Div(air.H1("Home page"), air.A("View cart", href=cart.url()))
```

## Query Parameters

Air supports query parameters through FastAPI's `Query()` validator, which you can import as `air.Query()`:

```
import air

app = air.Air()


@app.get("/search")
def search(q: str = air.Query(""), page: int = air.Query(1)):
    return air.H1(f"Search: {q} (page {page})")


# Generate URLs with query parameters
@app.page
def index():
    return air.Div(
        air.A("Search", href=search.url(query_params={"q": "air", "page": 1}))
    )
```

The `.url()` method accepts a `query_params` argument for generating URLs with query strings. This works with both scalar values and lists:

```
@app.get("/filter")
def filter_items(
    tags: list[str] | None = air.Query(None),
):  # List parameters require explicit air.Query(None) for parsing
    return air.H1(f"Filtered by: {tags}")


# Generates: /filter?tags=python&tags=web
url = filter_items.url(query_params={"tags": ["python", "web"]})
```

______________________________________________________________________

Use routing if you want a single cohesive app where all routes share middlewares and error handling.

## AirRoute

```
AirRoute(*args, **kwargs)
```

Bases: `APIRoute`

Custom APIRoute that uses Air's custom AirRequest class.

Source code in `src/air/routing.py`

```
def __init__(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
    """Initialize AirRoute and resolve string annotations from PEP 563."""

    endpoint = kwargs.get("endpoint") or (args[1] if len(args) > 1 else None)

    if endpoint is not None:
        original = cached_unwrap(endpoint)
        resolved_hints = get_type_hints(original, include_extras=True)
        sig = cached_signature(endpoint)
        endpoint.__signature__ = sig.replace(
            parameters=[
                param.replace(annotation=resolved_hints.get(name, param.annotation))
                for name, param in sig.parameters.items()
            ],
            return_annotation=resolved_hints.get("return", sig.return_annotation),
        )

    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
```

## AirRouter

```
AirRouter(
    *,
    prefix="",
    tags=None,
    dependencies=None,
    default_response_class=AirResponse,
    responses=None,

    deprecated=None,
    include_in_schema=True,
    generate_unique_id_function=default_generate_unique_id,
    path_separator="-",
)
```

Bases: `RouterMixin`

`AirRouter` class, used to group *path operations*, for example to structure an app in multiple files. It would then be included in the `App` app, or in another `AirRouter` (ultimately included in the app).

Example

````
```python
import air

app = air.Air()
router = air.AirRouter()


@router.get("/users/", tags=["users"])
async def read_users():
    return [{"username": "Rick"}, {"username": "Morty"}]


app.include_router(router)
````

## RouteCallable

Bases: `Protocol`

Protocol for route functions.

This protocol represents the interface of functions after being decorated
by route decorators like @app.get(), @app.post(), or @app.page(). The decorator
adds a .url() method to the function, allowing programmatic URL generation.

Example

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
def get_user(user_id: int) -> air.H1:
return air.H1(f"User {user_id}")

### The decorated function now has a .url() method

url = get_user.url(user_id=123) # Returns: "/users/123"

## RouterMixin

### get

```

get(\*args, \*\*kwargs)

```

Stub for type checking - implemented by subclasses.

Source code in `src/air/routing.py`

```

def get(self, \*args: Any, \*\*kwargs: Any) -> Any: """Stub for type checking - implemented by subclasses.""" raise NotImplementedError

```

### page

```

page(func)

```

Decorator that creates a GET route using the function name as the path.

Underscores in the function name are converted to dashes in the URL.
If the name of the function is "index", then the route is "/".

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `RouteCallable` | The decorated function registered as a page route. |

Example:

```

import air

app = air.Air() router = air.AirRouter()

@app.page def index() -> air.H1: # route is "/" return air.H1("I am the home page")

@router.page def data() -> air.H1: # route is "/data" return air.H1("I am the data page")

@router.page def about_us() -> air.H1: # route is "/about-us" return air.H1("I am the about page")

app.include_router(router)

```

Source code in `src/air/routing.py`

```

def page(self, func: FunctionType) -> RouteCallable: """Decorator that creates a GET route using the function name as the path.

```
Underscores in the function name are converted to dashes in the URL.

    router = air.AirRouter()


    @app.page

        return air.H1("I am the home page")

    def data() -> air.H1:  # route is "/data"
        return air.H1("I am the data page")


    @router.page
    def about_us() -> air.H1:  # route is "/about-us"
        return air.H1("I am the about page")


    app.include_router(router)
"""
page_path = compute_page_path(func.__name__, separator=self.path_separator)

# Pin the route's response_class for belt-and-suspenders robustness
return self.get(page_path)(func)
```

```

### url_path_for

```

url_path_for(name, /, \*\*params)

```

Stub for type checking - implemented by subclasses.

```

def url_path_for(self, name: str, /, \*\*params: Any) -> str: """Stub for type checking - implemented by subclasses.""" raise NotImplementedError

# Templating

Air loves Jinja!

A common pattern is to use a Jinja template as the project base and then use Air Tags for individual content.

## JinjaRenderer

```
JinjaRenderer(directory, context_processors=None, env=None)
```

Template renderer to make Jinja easier in Air.

Parameters:

| `context_processors` | \`list\[Callable\[[Request], dict[str, Any]\]\] | None\`        | A list of Jinja-style context processors, functions that automatically injects variables or functions into the template context so they're available in every rendered template without passing them explicitly. |
| `env`                | \`Environment                                   | None\`        | The env is the central Jinja object that holds configuration, filters, globals, and template loading settings, and is responsible for compiling and rendering templates.                                         |

Example:

```
# Instantiate the render callable
jinja = JinjaRenderer('templates')

# Use for returning Jinja from views
@app.get('/')
async def home(request: Request):
    return jinja(
        request,
        'home.html',
        context={'id': 5}
     )

    # Can also pass in kwargs, which will be added to the context:
    return jinja(
        request,
        'home.html',
        name='Parmesan'
    )

    # Will render Air Tags sent into Jinja context
    return jinja(
        request,
        'home.html',
        content=air.Article(air.P('Cheddar'))
    )
```

Utils

## cached_signature

```
cached_signature(fn)
```

Get function signature with caching for performance.

This cached version significantly improves performance when inspecting the same function multiple times, which commonly happens during route registration and template rendering.

Parameters:

| Name | Type                 | Description             | Default    |
| ---- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| `fn` | `Callable[..., Any]` | The function to inspect | *required* |

Returns:

| Type        | Description                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `Signature` | The function's signature object |

Example:

```
from air.utils import cached_signature


def my_func(a: int, b: str) -> None:
    pass


sig = cached_signature(my_func)
# Subsequent calls with same function use cached result
sig2 = cached_signature(my_func)  # Fast!

    return inspect.signature(fn)
```

## cached_unwrap

```
cached_unwrap(fn)
```

# SVG

In the spirit of helping our users, every **Air SVG Tag** has copious documentation—enough that sometimes it breaks the documentation build process. Therefore, **Air SVG Tag** that directly correspond to their SVG equivalents can be found in smaller, easier-to-compile pages.

- [SVG Air Tags A-D](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/svg/svg-tags-a-d/index.md)
- [SVG Air Tags E-M](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/svg/svg-tags-e-m/index.md)
- [SVG Air Tags N-S](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/svg/svg-tags-n-s/index.md)
- [SVG Air Tags T-Z](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/svg/svg-tags-t-z/index.md)

What remains on this page are core **Air SVG Tag** that either have great utility or are base classes for other tags.

Air is proud to provide first class SVG support. The entire SVG specification is supported.

# Tags

Note

Tags, or **Air Tag**, are explained in the [concepts document about tags](https://docs.airwebframework.org/learn/air_tags/index.md).

In the spirit of helping our users, every **Air Tag** has copious documentation—enough that sometimes it breaks the documentation build process. Therefore, **Air Tag** that directly correspond to their HTML equivalents can be found in smaller, easier-to-compile pages.

- [HTML Air Tags A-D](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/tags/tags-a-d/index.md)
- [HTML Air Tags E-M](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/tags/tags-e-m/index.md)
- [HTML Air Tags N-S](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/tags/tags-n-s/index.md)
- [HTML Air Tags T-Z](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/tags/tags-t-z/index.md)

What remains on this page are core **Air Tag** that either have great utility (**Raw** and **Children** come to mind), or are base classes for other tags.

Easy to write and performant HTML content generation using Python classes to render HTML.

## Tag

```
Tag(*children)
```

Bases: `Transparent`

Alias for the `Transparent` tag; use it if it improves clarity.

Source code in `src/air/tags/models/special.py`

```
def __init__(
    self,
    *children: Renderable,
) -> None:
    super().__init__(*children)
```

## Raw

```
Raw(text_child='', /, **attributes)
```

Bases: `UnSafeTag`, `Transparent`

Renders raw HTML content without escaping.

Raises:

| Type        | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `TypeError` | If non-string content is provided |

Example: Raw('**Bold** text')

# Produces '**Bold** text'

# Use with other tags

Div( P("Safe content"), Raw('

______________________________________________________________________

'), P("More safe content") )

Source code in `src/air/tags/models/special.py`

```
@override
def __init__(self, text_child: str = "", /, **attributes: AttributeType) -> None:
    if not isinstance(text_child, str):
        msg = f"{self!r} only accepts string content"
        raise TypeError(msg)
    if text_child:
        super().__init__(text_child, **attributes)
    else:
        super().__init__(**attributes)
```

## Children

```
Children(*children)
```

Bases: `Transparent`

Alias for the `Transparent` tag; use it if it improves clarity.

Source code in `src/air/tags/models/special.py`

```
def __init__(
    self,
    *children: Renderable,
) -> None:
    super().__init__(*children)
```

## SafeStr

Bases: `UserString`

String subclass that bypasses HTML escaping when rendered.

## BaseTag

```
BaseTag(*children, **attributes)
```

Base tag for all other tags.

Sets four attributes, name, module, children, and attrs. These are important for Starlette view responses, as nested objects get auto-serialized to JSON and need to be rebuilt. With the values of these attributes, the object reconstruction can occur.

Parameters:

| Name         | Type            | Description                                             | Default |

| `children`   | `Renderable`    | Renderable objects that become the tag's inner content. | `()`    |
| `attributes` | `AttributeType` | Attribute names and values applied to the tag element.  | `{}`    |

Source code in `src/air/tags/models/base.py`

```
