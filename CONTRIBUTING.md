# Contributing to the Air 💨 Web Framework!

##### Prerequisites:

1. Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installing-uv) installed.
2. Make sure you have [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) installed.

#### 1. Create the fork on GitHub, clone it locally, and wire remotes correctly.

###### Autoconfigure the remotes(origin[your fork = your_github_username/air], upstream[original repo = feldroy/air]).

```bash
gh repo fork feldroy/air --clone --remote
```

#### 2. Move into the new project directory.

```bash
cd air
```

#### 3. Fetch the latest changes from upstream.

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

#### 4. Create and switch to a new feature branch starting from upstream/main.

```bash
git switch -c your-new-branch-name upstream/main
```

#### 5. Update the project's environment (ensures that all project dependencies are installed and up-to-date with the lockfile).

```bash
uv sync --frozen --extra all
```

#### 6. Configure your IDE with the uv environment:

###### 1. VS Code (macOS, Linux, Windows):

> 1. Open the project folder (air) in VS Code.
> 2. Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux) → “Python: Select Interpreter”.
> 3. Choose “Enter interpreter path…”, paste the path to `.venv/bin/python`, and press Enter.
> 4. If .venv appears, select it. If not, choose Enter interpreter path… and use:
>     - macOS/Linux: ./.venv/bin/python
>     - Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe

###### 2. PyCharm (macOS, Linux, Windows):

> 1. Open the project folder (air) in PyCharm → Settings → Python → Interpreter → "Add Interpreter"
>    → "Add Local Interpreter" → "select existing" → "select existing" → "select existing":
>    - "Type": `uv`.
>    - "Path to uv": `$ which uv`
>    - "uv env use": `<project>/air/.venv/bin/python`.
> 2. Click OK/Apply. More details: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/uv.html

#### 7. Make your code changes and write/adjust tests to cover them (keep changes focused and small).

#### 8. Format the code and auto-fix simple issues(lint) with Ruff and Type check the project with Ty and pyrefly.

```bash
just qa
```

Make sure `just qa` does not produce any errors before you open a PR!

#### 9. Run the full pytest test suite

```bash
just test
```

Make sure `just test` does not produce any errors before you open a PR!

#### 10. Make a single commit that includes your tracked file changes with a clear message.

```bash
git commit -am "<type>(<optional scope>): <description><optional body><optional footer>"
```

For more info, see: [Conventional Commits Cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)

#### 11. Push your branch to your fork and set the remote tracking.

```bash
git push -u origin your-new-branch-name
```

#### 12. Open a Pull Request back to feldroy/air with a prefilled title and body (edit as needed).

```bash
gh pr create --fill --repo feldroy/air
```

## Types of Contributions we're looking for

We are actively looking for contributions in the following areas:

* **Bug fixes:** If you find a bug, please feel free to submit a pull request with a fix.
* **Refactoring:** We welcome improvements to the existing codebase for clarity, performance, and maintainability.
* **Documentation:** Enhancements to our documentation, including docstrings, are always appreciated.
* **Features:** Any FEAT (feature) ticket marked with `Status: Approved`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have an idea for a **new** feature, discuss it with us by opening an issue before writing any code. We want to
> keep Air light and breezy instead of adding too much to this package.


### Features: Categories

We have the following categories for features. All new features will be assigned a category label to determine whether or not it should be added to Air and what role it will take in terms of maintenance. The categories and their definitions are below:

|Category|Label|
|---|---|
|Core Air Feature|Feature: Core| 
|Optional Air Feature|Feature: Optional|
|Third-Party Integrated Feature|Feature: Third-Party Integrated|
|Out-of-Scope Feature|Feature: Out-of-Scope|

    
#### Core Air Feature

Implemented and maintained in the main Air repository; enabled by default. Fully documented and covered by tests; receives security and bug fixes promptly. Examples include Air Tags and FastAPI integration controls.
    
#### Optional Air Feature

Implemented in the Air repository but off by default; installed via extras. Documented and tested, but opt-in to keep the core small and fast. Receives updates together with Air releases and follows the same support policy. Examples include authentication and CSRF validation.
    
#### Third-Party Integrated Feature

Not implemented by Air; we provide official guides and examples for integrating an external library. Docs may include minimal glue code and recommended settings, but ownership stays with the third party. An example would be SQL integration or a quick guide on using a frontend library that isn't HTMX.
    
#### Out-of-Scope Feature

Not implemented, not documented, and not supported by the project. Requests are redirected to community solutions or closed as "out of scope."

### Documentation: Docstrings and API Reference

The API reference is generated from docstrings in this code, and the docs are built by
the [github.com/feldroy/airdocs](https://github.com/feldroy/airdocs) project. All public functions, classes, and methods
require complete docstrings. This will help us maintain a high-quality documentation site. Rules for writing docstrings:

- Every function, class, and method should have a docstring
- Every new public callable (function, class, or method) **must include at least one working example** in its docstring.
  - This helps ensure all code is:
    - easy to understand and test,
    - automatically verifiable through doctests or example tests, and
    - consistent across the documentation site.
- Docstrings should be clear, concise, and informative
- Docstrings are written in Markdown format
- HTML tags are not allowed in docstrings unless surrounded by backticks (e.g., `<tag>` should be written as
  `` `<tag>` ``) or inside code blocks (e.g., ```` ```html <tag> ``` ````)
- Use [Google style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for all
  public functions, classes, and methods.
    - Use the `Args:` and `Return:` (or `Yields:` for generators) directives to document parameters and return values
    - Use the `Example:` directive to document how to use the function, class, or method being documented.

## Plugins vs. Core Features

We do not have a plugin system yet, but when we do:

Try to implement features as plugins rather than adding them to the core codebase. This will keep the core codebase
small and focused.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, try the following:

* Delete `.venv/` and run `uv venv` again to recreate the virtualenv.
* Make sure you are not accidentally activating another virtualenv in your shell startup files.
* If code changes do not seem to apply, run via `uv run <command>` (which auto-syncs), or re-run `uv sync`.
* Upgrade uv if needed: `uv self update`.
* Still stuck? File a GitHub issue with details.
