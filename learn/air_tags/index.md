# Air Tags

**Air Tags**, sometimes shortened to **Tags**, are Python classes that render HTML. They can be combined to render web pages or small components. **Air Tags** are typed and documented, working well with any code completion tool. They are designed to be an easy to write and performant HTML content generation system using Python classes to render HTML.

Note

This document covers how **Air Tags** work. The full reference for them is the [Air Tags reference](https://docs.airwebframework.org/api/tags/index.md).

## How **Air Tags** work

Used individually or combined into a greater whole, every Air Tag includes a `render()` method. When the `render()` method is called it returns a HTML representation of the Air Tag, as well as all the children of the Air Tag.

This example:

```
from air import H1, Article, P

content = Article(
    H1("Air Tags"),
    P(
        "Air Tags are a fast, expressive way to generate HTML.",
        class_="subtitle",
    ),
)
print(content)  # <air.Article("Defines an article")>
```

In constructing this example, the `Article` tag has wrapped the `H1` and `P` tags. You can't see that the `H1` and `P` tags are inside, but they have been carefully stored.

This is the output of the `render()` method for the example above:

```
content.render()
```

```
<article>
  <h1>Air Tags</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Air Tags are a fast, expressive way to generate HTML.</p>
</article>
```

A shortcut for the `render()` method is the `str()` built-ins.

```
str(content)
```

```
<article>
  <h1>Air Tags</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Air Tags are a fast, expressive way to generate HTML.</p>
</article>
```

The `print()` built-in also does this conversion, but the result goes to `stdout`, so can't be saved to a variable.

```
print(content)
```

```
<article>
  <h1>Air Tags</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Air Tags are a fast, expressive way to generate HTML.</p>
</article>
```

Note

When returned from an Air view this conversion to HTML happens automatically, much like how FastAPI automatically converts `dict` responses to JSON.

## Pretty HTML renders

What if we want a more human-friendly display of HTML? We can use `.pretty_render()` method on any Air Tag:

```
print(content.pretty_render())
```

```
<article>
  <h1>Air Tags</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Air Tags are a fast, expressive way to generate HTML.</p>
</article>
```

Tip

Combine Air Tag's `.pretty_render()` method with the [rich package](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) for truly lovely colorized output.

## Attributes

**Air Tags** convert keyword arguments into attributes. So:

```
import air

air.P("Hello", id_="mine")
```

renders as:

```
<p id="mine">Hello</p>
```

Let's take a look at some additional scenarios.

### Python reserved words as attributes

Some HTML attributes are reserved words in Python. To get around that, **Air Tags** uses specific keyword arguments for these reserved words.

| Reserved Word | Use This Keyword Argument |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| class         | class\_                   |
| for           | for\_                     |
| async         | async\_                   |
| id            | id\_                      |
| as            | as\_                      |

Note

These are the reserved words that we've discocevered that conflict with HTML attributes. If you run into others, please open an issue on GitHub.

#### Setting the `class` attribute

In Python `class` is a protected word. To set the `class` attribute in **Air Tags**, use the `class_` keyword.

```
air.P("Hello", class_="plain")
```

renders as

```
<p class="plain">Hello</p>
```

#### Setting the `for` attribute

In Python `for` is a protected word. To set the `for` attribute in **Air Tags**, use the `for_` keyword.

```
air.Label("Email", air.Input(name="email", type_="email"), for_="email")
```

renders as

```
<label for="email">Email<input name="email" type="email" /></label>
```

#### Setting the `async` attribute

In Python `async` is a protected word. To set the `async` attribute in **Air Tags**, use the `async_` keyword.

```
air.Script(
    'console.log("Hello, world!");',
    async_=True,
)
```

renders as

```
<script async>
  console.log("Hello, world!");
</script>
```

### Attributes starting with special characters

To get around that in Python we can't begin function arguments with special characters, we lean into how **Air Tags** is kwargs friendly.

```
air.P("Hello", class_="plain", **{"@data": 6})
```

Renders as:

```
<p class="plain" @data="6">Hello</p>
```

### Single word attributes

To set or hide single word attributes like `@selected`, set the tag to `True` or `False` respectively.

```
air.Select(
    air.Option("South America", value="SA", selected=True),
    air.Option("North America", value="NA", selected=False),
)
```

Renders as:

```
<select>
  <option selected value="SA">South America</option>
  <option value="NA">North America</option>
</select>
```

Note

For the sake of clarity this example was rendered using `print(content.pretty_render())`.

If you need a value set to `true`, use `"true"` in Python. For example:

```
air.P("Air makes FastAPI web pages easy", draggable="true")
```

Renders as:

```
<p draggable="true">Air makes FastAPI web pages easy</p>
```

## Works well with SVGs

Unlike HTML, SVG tags are case-sensitive. You can access SVG tags by importing them from the `air.svg` module. Here's a simple example:

```
from air import svg

svg.Svg(
    svg.Circle(cx="50", cy="50", r="40", fill="blue"),
    width="100",
    height="100",
)
```

This will render the following SVG:

```
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle fill="blue" cx="50" cy="50" r="40"></circle>
</svg>
```

Note

For the sake of clarity this example was rendered using `print(content.pretty_render())`.

## Custom Air Tags

The best way to define your own **Air Tags** is to subclass the `air.Tag` class. Here's a simple example:

```
from air import Tag


class Tasty(Tag):
    pass
```

Let's instantiate this class and call its `render()` method:

```
Tasty("Ice Cream", class_="dessert").render()
```

This will produce the following HTML:

```
<tasty class="desert">Ice Cream</tasty>
```

## Functions as Custom **Air Tags**

Subclasses are not the only way to create custom Air Tags. You can also use functions to create Air Tags. This is particularly useful for putting together components quickly without needing to define a class. Here's an example of a function that creates a custom Air Tag for a [picocss card](https://picocss.com/docs/card):

```
def card(*content, header: str, footer: str):
    return air.Article(air.Header(header), *content, air.Footer(footer))
```

We can use this function to create a card:

```
card(
    air.P("This is a card with some content."),
    air.P("It can have multiple paragraphs."),
    header="Card Header",
    footer="Card Footer",
).render()
```

Which produces the following HTML:

```
<article>
  <header>Card Header</header>
  <p>This is a card with some content.</p>
  <p>It can have multiple paragraphs.</p>
  <footer>Card Footer</footer>
</article>
```

Note

For the sake of clarity this example was rendered using `print(card(...).pretty_render())`.

## Returning Multiple Children (used in HTMX)

When using HTMX to add reactivity to pages, it is common to return several **Air Tags** so that HTMX can then replace existing DOM elements with new ones. **Air Tags** are hierarchical, you need a base tag that just serves as a wrapper that doesn't generate any HTML. That tag is the `air.Tags`. Here's how to use it:

```
import air


@app.post("/cart/add/{product_id}/")
def update_cart(request: air.Request, product_id: int):
    "This is a simplified update cart view"
    # air.Tags renders the child tags without adding anything of its own
    return air.Tags(
        # Mark that an item has been added to the cart
        Button(
            "Added!",
            hx_post="/cart/add/{{product.id}}",
            hx_swap_oob="true",
            id_="add-button",
        ),
        # Cart icon quantity changed
        A(
            f"Cart {count}",
            id_="cart-icon",
            href="/cart",
            hx_trigger="polling 30s",
            hx_get="/cart-icon",
            hx_swap_oob="true",
        ),
    )
```

This will generate HTML that looks something like this, without any wrapping text around the elements we are passing to the user's browser:

```
<!-- Mark that an item has been added to the cart -->
<button hx-post="/cart/add/35" hx-swap-oob="true" id="add-button">Added!</button>
<!-- Cart icon quantity changed -->
<a id="cart-icon" href="/cart" hx-trigger="polling 30s" hx-get="/cart-icon" hx-swap-oob="true">Cart 2</a>
```

## Converting HTML to Air Tags

The easiest way to do that is with the `BaseTag.from_html_to_source` method.

```
import air

air.BaseTag.from_html_to_source("""
<html>
    <body>
        <main>
            <h1 class="header">Hello, World</h1>
        </main>
    </body>
</html>""")
```

This generates:

```
air.Html(air.Body(air.Main(air.H1("Hello, World", class_="header"))))
```
