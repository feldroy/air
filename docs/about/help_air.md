# Helping Air and getting help about Air

Are you fan of Air? Want to learn more about Air?

Want to help others learn more about Air?

We're happy to assist with both!

## Star **Air** in GitHub  ‚≠êÔ∏è

You can "star" Air in GitHub (clicking the star button at the top right): [github.com/feldroy/air](https://github.com/feldroy/air).

By adding a star, other users will be able to find it more easily and see that it has been already useful for others.

## Watch the GitHub repository for releases üëÄ

You can "watch" Air in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): [github.com/feldroy/air](https://github.com/feldroy/air).

There you can select "Releases only".

By doing it, you will receive notifications (in your email) whenever there's a new release (a new version) of Air with bug fixes and new features.

## Participate in discussions

Our primary location for chat is our [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/znf8vPsz47).

For non-code GitHub issues, we'll ask those to be moved to the Discord chat server.

See you there!

## Sponsor the project

Air is an open-source project that is free to use. We are constantly working to improve it. If you want to support the project financially, you can do so via <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/feldroy" target="_blank">our GitHub Sponsors page</a>.
