# Advanced Patterns and Best Practices

!!! warning "First draft!"
    
    Please treat this as a very early draft, and be careful with anything that this chapter says! We welcome your pull requests to help refine the material so it actually becomes useful.

## Application Structure

Organize your application into modules:

```
myblog/
├── main.py              # Application entry point
├── config.py            # Configuration settings
├── models.py            # Database models
├── schemas.py           # Pydantic schemas
├── database.py          # Database setup
├── routers/             # Route handlers
│   ├── web.py           # Web page routes
│   ├── api.py           # API routes
│   └── auth.py          # Authentication routes
├── templates/           # Jinja templates (if using)
└── static/              # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
```

## Separation of Concerns

Separate your routes into different modules:

```python
# routers/web.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
import air

web_router = APIRouter()

@web_router.page
def index():
    return air.P("Web page route")

# routers/api.py
from fastapi import APIRouter

api_router = APIRouter()

@api_router.get("/api/status")
def api_status():
    return {"status": "ok"}

# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
import air

app = air.Air()
app.include_router(web_router)
app.include_router(api_router, prefix="/api")
```

## Template Integration

While Air Tags are powerful, you can also use Jinja2 templates:

```python
from air import JinjaRenderer

jinja = JinjaRenderer(directory="templates")

@app.get("/jinja-page")
def jinja_page(request: air.Request):
    return jinja(request, "home.html", {"title": "Jinja Page", "articles": get_articles()})
```

## Background Tasks

Handle background tasks:

```python
@app.post("/submit-form")
async def submit_form_with_background_task(request: air.Request, background_tasks: air.BackgroundTasks):
    form_data = await request.form()
    
    # Process form in background
    background_tasks.add_task(send_email, form_data.get("email"), form_data.get("message"))
    
    return air.P("Form submitted successfully!")
```

## Error Handling

Add custom exception handlers:

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

@app.exception_handler(404)
async def not_found_handler(request: Request, exc):
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.H1("Page Not Found"),
        air.P("The requested page could not be found."),
        air.A("← Back to Home", href="/")
    )
```

## Performance Optimization

1. **Caching**: Use FastAPI's caching mechanisms
2. **Database Optimization**: Use proper indexing and query optimization
3. **Static Asset Optimization**: Minimize CSS/JS and use CDNs
4. **Response Compression**: Enable gzip compression

## Appendix B: Common Patterns

### Form Handling Pattern
```python
# Define a form
class ContactForm(AirForm):
    class model(BaseModel):
        name: str = Field(..., min_length=2)
        email: str = AirField(type="email", required=True)

form = ContactForm()

# Handle form in route
@app.post("/contact")
async def contact_handler(request: air.Request):
    form_data = await request.form()
    if form.validate(form_data):
        # Process validated data
        validated_data = form.model.model_dump()
        # ... handle valid form
    else:
        # Render with errors
        return air.layouts.mvpcss(form.render())
```

### API + HTML Pattern
```python
# HTML page
@app.page
def dashboard():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        # Load data via JavaScript calling API
        air.Div(id="api-data"),
        air.Script(
            "fetch('/api/data').then(r => r.json()).then(data => {...})",
            type="module"
        )
    )

# API endpoint
@app.get("/api/data")
def api_data():
    return {"message": "Data from API"}
```

### HTMX Pattern
```python
# Page with HTMX features
@app.page
def interactive_page():
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.Div(
            air.Button("Click me", 
                      hx_post="/handle-click", 
                      hx_target="#result", 
                      hx_swap="innerHTML"),
            air.Div(id="result")
        )
    )

# HTMX handler
@app.post("/handle-click")
def handle_click():
    return air.Div("Updated content", id="result")
```
