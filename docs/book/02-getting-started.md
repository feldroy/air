# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you'll need:

1. **Python 3.12 or higher** (3.14 is recommended): The programming language we'll use. You can check your Python version with `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
2. **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installing-uv)**: A modern Python package and project manager that streamlines dependency management.
3. **A code editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended, though any Python-capable editor works.
4. **Basic command line familiarity**: Comfort with terminal commands like `cd`, `ls`/`dir`, etc.

## Installing Air

Let's start by creating a new project:

```bash
uv init myblog
```

This initializes a new Python project in a directory called `myblog`.

Familiarize yourself with the contents of a project created by `uv init`, if you're not already familiar:

```
myblog
├── .git
│   └── ...
├── .gitignore
├── .python-version
├── main.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

Here's what each file is:

- **`.git`**: Git repository directory that tracks changes to your project
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore
- **`.python-version`**: Specifies the Python version to use for this project
- **`main.py`**: The main Python file where you'll write your application code
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Project configuration file that includes dependencies and build settings
- **`README.md`**: Documentation file for your project

Now would be a good time to commit your work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize myblog project with uv"
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd myblog
```

Open it in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
code .
```

Press `Ctrl+`` (backtick) to open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.

Set up a virtual environment for project isolation:

```bash
uv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# On Mac/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install Air with standard dependencies:

```bash
uv add "air[standard]"
```

This installs Air along with its recommended extensions for web development.

## Your First Air App

Replace the contents of `main.py` with:

```python title="main.py"
import air

app = air.Air()

@app.page
def index():
    title = "My Blog"  # TODO: Change this to your own blog title!
    return air.layouts.mvpcss(
        air.Head(air.Title(title)),
        air.H1(title),
        air.P("Welcome to my awesome Air-powered blog."),
    )
```

This creates a simple web application with:

- `import air`: Imports the Air framework
- `app = air.Air()`: Creates a new Air application instance
- `@app.page`: Decorator that maps the function to the root path `/`
- The function returns a complete HTML document using Air's layout system

!!! tip "Make It Yours!"
    This tutorial will be a lot more fun if you use it to make a real blog for yourself! Change that `"My Blog"` title to something that reflects your personality or interests. Here are some fun examples to get your creative juices flowing:
    
    - `"Carla's Tech Adventures"` or `"John's Culinary Journey"`
    - `"The Daily Musings of a Cat Lover"`
    - `"Code & Coffee"` or `"Python Ponderings"`
    - `"Creative Uma's Awesome Blog"` or `"Sony's Random Thoughts About Board Games"`
    - Get creative: `"The Midnight Coder's Chronicles"` or `"From Zero to Hero"`
    
    Don't forget to also update the paragraph text to match your personal style - maybe `"Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share my passion for [your topic]!"` or `"Thanks for stopping by my digital space!"`

Run the development server:

```bash
fastapi dev
```

Visit your application at: <a href="http://localhost:8000/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8000/</a>

!!! question "Why are we using fastapi to run Air?"

    Air is built on top of FastAPI, so we use the `fastapi` CLI command to run our Air application. This allows us to leverage FastAPI's powerful features while enjoying the simplicity and elegance of Air for building our web pages.

## Understanding Your First Application

Let's break down what's happening in this code:

1. **Import**: `import air` imports the Air framework
2. **App Creation**: `app = air.Air()` creates a new Air application instance
3. **Decorator**: `@app.page` is a decorator that tells Air to handle requests to the root path (`/`)
4. **Function**: `index()` is the function that processes the request and returns the response
5. **Layout**: `air.layouts.mvpcss()` provides a complete HTML document structure with basic styling

The `mvpcss` layout function automatically:

- Wraps content in proper HTML structure
- Includes MVP.css for basic styling
- Includes HTMX for interactive features
- Separates head and body content automatically

!!! info "More on Layouts"
    We'll explore layouts in much more detail in the [Air Tags and Layouts](04-air-tags-and-layouts.md) section, including how to create your own custom layouts.

**Air Tags**: The HTML elements you see in the code (`H1`, `P`, etc.) are called "Air Tags". These are Python classes that generate HTML. Each tag (like `H1`, `P`, `Div`) corresponds to an HTML element. When you create an instance of an Air Tag, it renders to the corresponding HTML:

```python
air.H1("Hello, World!")  # Renders as <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
air.P("This is a paragraph")  # Renders as <p>This is a paragraph</p>
```

Air Tags are type-safe and provide IDE autocompletion, making it easier to write correct HTML.

    We'll dive deeper into Air Tags, their attributes, and advanced usage in the [Air Tags and Layouts](04-air-tags-and-layouts.md) section.

Now would be a good time to commit your work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add minimal Air app with index page"
```
